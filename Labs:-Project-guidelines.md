When building a project or taking on an initiative, and before releasing, consider these questions:

Is the container image as clean and as small as it can be (consider using Alpine base images)?
Are we using Dockerfile best practices?
Does it work by default?
If you were giving a live demo, would you ever have to say “that part isn’t finished yet”?

# Idea validation checklist
Referenced in Validation to [Layer 1](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/balenaLabs/_edit#layer-1-brainstorm-build-and-promote) workflow
* Does running this project on balena help the user (IoT tinkerer/hacker, fleet owner, etc.?
* Are we lowering the bar of entry to a scaled use case?
* Are we using or improving upon any existing primitives?
* Are we creating any new primitives?
* Does completing this project enhance our framework?
* Are we demonstrating a new balena feature?
* Is it an ambient computing project?
* Is it an integration with another company/provider/platform?
* Does it have a chance of viral attention?
* Is it awesome?

# Results & Outcomes

-2 - the fact that this project exists causes confusion and support issues - delete it

-1 - project has little to no users, downloads, or interactions. Archive to make clear that it is no longer maintained or supported in any way, but it's still visible.

0 - project helps users by the fact that it exists to provide a demonstration of a feature or example code, but is not showing any signs of growth. Continue to maintain it as a low priority

1 - project is high ROI, baseline for others to beat, continue to promote whenever possible until better project appears or project conversion rates fade

2 - escape velocity: project generates own community and hype. if ROI drops low enough, cut loose but continue to develop. otherwise continue to invest.

3 - profit potential: project has connected product that shows hints of sustainability, consider developing further to get to sustainable status
possible flow reversal: profitable projects may fund their own promotion, therefore tilting the ROI equation

4 - users show strong interest in new features, if we feel further development can drive the project to high ROI or outcome 0/1/2, return to implementation phase for another run

5 - project is showing signs of explosive growth in all dimensions. Brainstorm out-of-the-box ways to capitalize, including "fold into product", "make own tributary/loop", "spin off into its own startup", or whatever else makes sense in the context of that project.
