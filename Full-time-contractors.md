Resin.io provides its full-time contractors a 30 days time off package. Some info about your package, fellow full-time contractor:

This package includes both your country's public holidays and your time off holidays. Tracking down each parliament's annual decision of public holidays isn't exactly our field of expertise so you have to choose your time off days wisely.

You can't take all of your days off immediately. Each month you work you gain some days. That is (30/12=) 2.5 days per month. If your country has a big amount of public holidays in the first trimester that exceeds your gained time off days, please contact one of the approvers (Alexandros Marinos, Petros Angelatos, Apostolis Michalakos) and they'll be happy to deal with this issue.

All requests must be made from your account in the leave management system we're using, Calamari. Read this [short Calamari getting started guide](https://docs.google.com/a/resin.io/document/d/1tSKx8T78QFJMOzXrqIKcN7lwEPM41VbBG7B_ILEOkBQ/edit?usp=sharing) to find your way around it.

You can't transfer days from one year to another. Either you get these days or not. You can't trade your holidays for cash either.

Like employees, the approver isn't obliged to approve every date range you request. A two-week time-off request just before a launch or a major system failure probably isn't gonna make it nor a massive 30-day request from 15th of November to 31st of December. Summer time, for example, is a more logical approach.

For the avoidance of any doubt, the total number of your time off (holidays, public/bank holidays) can exceed the 30-days limit only by taking unpaid holidays.
