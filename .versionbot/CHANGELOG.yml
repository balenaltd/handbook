      hash: 26ad1c094a04f9daed6e6e3d516a8ed4a229e911

        This reverts commit a42926daa066600632eb37609a0184c4ef038062.

        The use of issue ops is being restricted due to security concerns,
        so we can remove it from the handbook for now.

      hash: 6395334df51ea5530d9e2c66a4c5ad900fc7765c
      body: >
        Removed references to Zoom as a basic tool, and replaced it with Google
        Meet as that's currently our main service for company calls. Zoom is
        still being used occasionally and by specific people (i.e. CS team).
