Some balenistas live in the [labs](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/balenaLabs). They make and maintain projects, help communicate the potential of balena, get feedback and advocate to improve the product. But that doesn't mean that other balenistas cannot spend time in the [labs](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/balenaLabs) and also do those good things. At various times (such as when they join balena) people may wish to have a residency in the [labs](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/balenaLabs), typically for about a month, to work on a project.

# New Joiners
When you applied for a job at balena you probably applied for a certain role, such as a frontend developer or an embedded Linux engineer. However what we really wanted was for good people to apply to work at balena, and *then* find the hard problem they are passionate about solving. Our mission at balena is to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT device fleet owners. But we can only do that if we seek out those sources of friction by living as a IOT device fleet owner. It doesn't matter what area of the mission you are contributing to: operational or technical, there is friction to be found and removed. So what better way to find that friction than to *become* our user, make an IOT project and live the experience? 

Your first mission in balena is to make a project, and take it through it's full lifecycle:
* explore project ideas and select one
* build the project
* put the project into the public domain
* get feedback and make improvements
* publicise your project by writing a post on the [balena blog](https://www.balena.io/blog/tag/project/)

## Choosing a project
Ideally your project is going to be something you are really passionate about. If you love all things security-related, then maybe build a firewall or a pen' tester kit. Here are some handy [guidelines](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Labs:-Project-guidelines) as to what makes a good balena project. But more than anything, make something you really care about. The more you love your project, the more you're going to want the balena product to help you build and maintain it.

### I don't know what to make!!!
We get it: not everyone comes into balena with a project idea in their back pocket. And some people don't know what they may want to build. Fear not, we have an [idea pool](https://trello.com/b/Xd2ykrMD/balenalabs) - currently on Trello but soon to move to a github project.
Choose something from the ideas pool, and assign yourself to it. Done! :)

### I've looked at the ideas pool, and I still don't know!!!!!!
No worries, the labs team is here to help you. The best thing to do is to post on the /balenalabs flow on FlowDock and let everyone know you're struggling for ideas. This is a great opportunity for us all to get to know you better, find out the things you like to do, and brainstorm project ideas for you.

## Building the project
You will gain a mentor as part of your residency, called a project sherpa. This person is an old hand at project building, and will help guide you. They will help you to understand how we work, the development loop(s) and what makes a good project into a great project. This role of project sherpa should be fluid, so although you will initially be paired with someone, that won't be set in stone. If your project is in an area where another balenaista has some expertise - that person can slide into the sherpa role for you.

## Publicise your project
To complete your mission, you need to let the whole world know about your project. But you don't have to do this alone, once again your team has your back. Balena has a whole [Outreach](https://www.flowdock.com/app/rulemotion/resin-propaganda) team of people who love helping others spread the balena word. When the time is right (your Sherpa will help you know) post a message in the outreach flow and let folks know. They will help you get going with a blog post template and some guidance. They'll even design you some cool graphics for your post, and jam on your writing with you to make it read and look amazing.
