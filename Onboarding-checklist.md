Before anything else let's check that everything is in order and that there's no other action pending. Here's all the different stuff you have been doing today. Please check carefully that all are in place.

* Signed the contracts
* Obtained a @balena.io email account
* Have access to the Balena Admin, Balena Social, Calamari and Support calendar
* Have access to the following services
   * Flowdock - username should be GitHub username
   * Calamari
   * Front - username should be GitHub username
   * Zoom
   * Github
   * Jellyfish
   * Trello
* Shared your 'first day as a balena user' experience in Flowdock `r/product` flow, using **#internal_feedback** or make a note to do so in the next few days :) 
* Filed an issue to the relevant Github repo to add your location to the balena team map

If your checklist is full of ticks and you have created the balena account using your balena email address, then it's time to contact the Operations team using @@operations in the `t/operations` flow in Flowdock to let them know and share your account username with them, so they can give you team member access. 

Don't forget to use #access and @@operations if you want to request access to anything further. There are more services and tools we use, but this section focuses on the main ones that you need to make sure you have access from Day 1. 

In case you're not aware of what your next task is yet, make sure you take your time to watch the summit presentations linked further down at the `summit section` and check for any onboarding introductory meeting invites coming your way. Don't forget that you can jump on most calls in the shared Balena Admin calendar to get an idea of how these are structured and facilitated. We normally keep meetings with any sensitive information between smaller groups. The brainstorm calls can be a good starting point and you can also listen to previous recordings. You can find more information further down at the `meetings section`.  

Just a reminder about this [new starter checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cQZz8in9iEhsM2_LNaI36tvX_TH1c7RgC-uem78aMV8/edit?ts=5fb3d7b8#gid=0) which can help you stay on track with some key tasks for your first few weeks!
