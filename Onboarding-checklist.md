* Signed the contracts
* Obtained a @balena.io email account
* Have access to the Balena Admin, Balena Social, Calamari and Support calendar
* Have access to the following services
   * Flowdock - username should be GitHub username
   * Calamari
   * Front - username should be GitHub username
   * Zoom
   * Github
   * balena support-agent access
   * Intercom
   * Jellyfish
* Shared your 'first day as a balena user' experience in Flowdock `r/product` flow, using **#internal_feedback**

If your checklist is full of ticks then it's time to contact the Operations Team using @@operations and the `t/operations` flow to let them know. Don't forget to use #access and @@operations if you want to request access to anything further.

In case you're not aware of what your next task is yet, make sure you take your time to watch the summit presentations linked further down this wiki and check for any onboarding meeting invites coming your way.
