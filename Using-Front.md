# Front

At resin.io we try use Front inboxes for much of our workflows. We try connect as many data sources as we can here.

One of the core functions of Front is as a frontend for our customer support process. 

## Creating a Github Issue From Front Convo

## Resin.io FrontApp Side bar

To aid the support work we have built a custom side bar for the [front inbox](https://app.frontapp.com/inboxes/shared/intercom/open/latest).

### Setting Up the Side Bar
1. Before you try set up your side bar make sure your resin.io account is an admin. i.e.: you should be able to login and browse around admin.resin.io
2. Log into front and click on the arrow (<=) in the top right of front dashboard.

3. In the side bar at the top, click the `âˆ¨` down caret and select `Resin 1#`
4. Now login to the side bar with your resin admin account. If you not set up, ask Apostolis.
5. You should now see a side bar that looks something like this:

### Using the Sidebar

#### Starting a Flowdock Thread from a Front Ticket
When a new conversation comes through that you are not sure about and want to raise on flowdock. Just open the side bar for that conversation, then use the dropdown on the right of the blue button to select which room you want to post the message to. Once you select one, just hit the button and it will be auto posted in that flow.

#### Linking a previous/current Flowdock to a Front Ticket
To link a previous or ongoing flowdock thread to a ticket on front all you need to do is copy the `#hashtag` in the side bar and paste it into the flowdock thread that you want to link it to. The sidebar should automatically update to reflect linked conversations. You can see an example below of a ticket with one associated flowdock thread, this thread was added by pasting `#front-cnv_20upq9` into flowdock thread:
