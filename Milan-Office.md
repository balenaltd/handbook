## Here are the guidelines/rules/procedures we've put together to make sure we can reopen the office and keep it a safe environment for everyone.
* If you are sick, have a fever, have tested positive for COVID-19, or believe you have been exposed to somebody with COVID-19, don’t schedule to visit the office for at least 14 days, and please cancel if you are scheduled to visit and develop symptoms in the meantime.
* If you can work from home, work from home. Only go into the office if you need to be there to do your work, or pick something up to bring home for your work.
* Limit the amount of time you spend in the office to the minimum needed to accomplish your work.
* If you need the office to do your work, but don’t feel comfortable going into the office, please let us know - nobody should go to the office who doesn’t feel comfortable doing so.
* The office is limited to one person in the office at a time, with a 30min buffer between visits. Please check the calendar and schedule with Hubot/the office calendar at least 24 hours in advance (preferably more) if you are planning to visit the office.
* No visitors are allowed for the time being.
* Whenever you enter the office, please wash your hands thoroughly first thing. There will be a touchless soap dispenser and paper towels provisioned, as well as hand sanitizer.
* The kitchenette will remain temporarily closed. Bottled water will be the only provisioning for the time being.
* Please measure your temperature before coming to the office, you will also find an infrared thermometer at the office to measure your temperature entrance as per the indications of Lombardy Region.
* At each desk there will be individual spray bottles of  hand sanitizers and antibacterial cleaning agents, as well as antibacterial wipes and microfibre cloths; this is to keep our workspaces/shared contact points separated/minimized. There are also single-use masks as well as nitrile gloves - this is not necessitated but if you would like to. Please keep the provisioning only for use in office purposes.
* At the end of each visit, leave the office a clean and safe space for the next person. Please use the cleaning agent and microfibre to spray and wipe down contact points - your desk, chair, keyboard/mice, as well as high touch-points like door handles, light switches, and intercom if you've used it to answer the door.
