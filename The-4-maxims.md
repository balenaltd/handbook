These are guidelines that help ensure we have proper communication internally (given we're a remote team) and externally (to inform users of what we do):
* If it's not on chat it didn't happen
* If it's not in the issue tracker it won't get done
* If it's not on the wiki we won't remember it
* If it's not on the blog it's not released
