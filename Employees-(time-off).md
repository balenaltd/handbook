The time off for employees is defined by each country's labour law. In short, non-working days for employees are each country's public/bank holidays plus the days that the employee chooses to use as holiday**. Of course some time off for medical issues apply but for more info and further clarifications one can look up to his/hers country's labour law.

A requirement for the time off is a two weeks notice.
You must request your time off days from your account in the leave management software we're using.

It's important that you log your time-off days to the leave management software, despite of the nature of the day (business day, bank holiday, national day etc).
e.g. Aggelos took 2 days-off, 29th-30th of April 2015, Wednesday and Thursday. But Friday, the 1st of May, is a public holiday in Greece. Aggelos included this date in his request, helping the approver understand that he'll be away for three days.

**you can choose which days you want to be off and which days you want to work. We strongly suggest that you take the bank holidays/national days according to your country's labour law, though.
