Teams are based around projects or metrics.

Teams have a short check in on Mondays.

Project-based teams maintain a spec-based roadmap, with ongoing progress reported.

Metrics-based teams maintain a mission statement, with ongoing progress reported. 

Progress is reported through a shared google doc (what used to be the check-in notes and updates in all-hands call).
