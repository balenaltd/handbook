## Introduction

Six months after our virtual annual summit in September 2020, we held what we called a Vision Week, or a sort of virtual mini-summit. The event took place in March 2021 and was a chance for us to catch up on what we’re building, why we’re building it, and how we’ll build it, without waiting a full year between summits. The goal was to refresh and converge on our vision and priorities for the upcoming year and beyond. We provided updates on some of the topics we discussed during September’s summit, and also introduced some new ones. It was a good opportunity to zoom out and add important context and perspective to help guide our work.

## Balena Hack Week March 2021

Following Vision Week, we also held a Hack Week. This was a week for the team to work on projects together, particularly things they wouldn’t normally work on, perhaps with people they wouldn’t normally work with. The theme was "short term pain for long term gain" and gave the team a chance to take what we talked about during Vision Week, apply their product builder creativity, and somehow contribute to our vision and goals.
