Here’s a guide of how-to-use the main features of our time-off service Calamari.

Our full Leave policy can be found [here](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Leave-Policy)

At first, you can log in with your @balena.io e-mail account, using the Google login option.

To request time-off just press “Request absence” then check out the following screenshots.

## First step

To successfully request an absence you need to choose a type of absence. 
Use the drop-down menu to check the absence types. **Leave** is from your bank of leave days for when you are on holiday, wanting to take a break etc. **Sick leave** is, obviously, the absence type you should choose when sick.

## Second step

After selecting the absence type, you will see how many days or hours of chosen absence you will be able to take. It will help you estimate the proper period you are requesting. You can request full or half days.

## Third and last step

The simplest way to request time off is by marking the requested period and by selecting it on the calendar.

## Personal available absence time (leave allowance)

At the “entitlement” option, on the left side menu, you will always find your current absence allowance. Please note that the first green bar in the screenshot that is not fully visible is your annual leave bank.
