Here’s a guide of how-to-use the main features of our time-off service Calamari.

At first, you can log in with your @balena.io e-mail account, using the Google login option.

To request time-off just press “Request absence” then check out the following screenshots.

## First step

To successfully request absence you need to choose type of absence you are requesting for. 
Use the drop-down menu to check the absence types. The “annual leave” is the 30 days that we all have available and the “support leave” refers to the extra time-off that balenistas gain for doing support. “Sick leave” is, obviously, the absence type you should choose when sick.

## Second step

After selecting the absence type, you will see how many days or hours of chosen absence you will be able to take. It will help you estimate the proper period you are requesting.

## Third and last step

The simplest way to request time off is by marking the requested period and by selecting it on the calendar.

## FAQ

**What does "Manually edited" field means in Calamari under the Entitlement / Annual leave?**

The days in the "Manually edited" field are the days (full amount) you're entitled to from the 1st of January to your anniversary hire date.

Every employee earns 30 days per year.
So, this number is the function: 
30 (days) x (Number of Days from 1st of Jan to anniversary date) / 365.

Example: if you were hired on the 30 of October 2015 then you have
30 x 302 / 365 = 24.82 days

The reason this number is on the "Manually Edited" field it's because the calamari team made the import so it's not calculated from previous years or other calculations but from a manual, initial, one time edit.
