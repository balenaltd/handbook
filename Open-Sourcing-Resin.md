As part of moving towards fully Open Sourcing the Resin codebase, there are currently a few checklist items that need to be worked through to ensure a repository is ready:

* Open up repository
  - Check security/business implications with Petros/Alex
  - Code Audit git & code
    * Include commit comments
    * Include code comments (e.g. builder comment)
    * Include history: **Note:** You will have to trawl the history to make sure there is nothing sensitive in it. If in doubt, ask.
    * Include issues: **Note:** Again, trawl the issue history to make sure there is nothing sensitive in it.
* Make it easy to contribute
  - Add docs and markdown files
  - Create brand and landing page
  - Announce new project

Security and business are a big part of this focus. We should not release anything that has any implications for Resin going forward. Ideally, ensure that you have someone review your work to ensure that it can be safely released.
