# Friday Hacks

Every Friday people can hack on projects that are some / any way connected to resin, but otherwise outside of the normal to-do list. Announce in `r/project` what you are working on on the day. @shaunmulligan reports on hacks on the Monday call for everyone to hear about the fun.

## Project Photos / Videos / Information

If you take any photos / videos during your project development (and you most likely should take some!), upload it to [Google Drive / FridayHacks](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2Os9XLYS_LZY2s4X1FWM2lLems) so it can be shared easier. Thank you! Would love to be able to publish our hacks through the blog, hackster, your own blog, etc...

## Hack ideas

Add you hack ideas here, to inspire others and remind yourself! Ideas here can be picked up by anyone else too, so mark it if you worked on it!
