# Friday Hacks
Each Friday we hold a company-wide hackathon for balena. Instead of your regularly scheduled tasks, you can work on a project of your choosing, though it must meet the following conditions:

1. It uses balena, or can attempt to break the security of balena, or can be a tool built using balena-sdk or balena-API or other balena components.
1. You can't use special privileges to code the project, you should not even have your balena developer environment running on Friday (i.e. any external user must be able to build the same project)
1. You must declare what project you'll be working on, on Flowdock -`s/projects`-, either before the end of your Thursday or at the morning of the hack day.
1. At the end of the day youâ€™re expected to file bug reports for any bugs you ran into and write a short paragraph of your experience with balena, things you noticed, areas you had friction, and share it with the Experience team, using the internal chat service.
1. The project should be reasonably scoped, although it does not have to be finished in one hack day and can stretch over 3 or 4 Fridays. Ideally, each hack day project should result in a nice github repo link and for awesome ones we will write a blog post about them.

The goal is to both get a feeling for our users' experience/pain as well as to produce fun projects which our users can build themselves - it's easy to forget the big picture when working on day-to-day tasks and this work helps compensate for that.

An additional benefit is that we get to test new functionality and file bug reports as we actually work with the platform, so ensure that any problems you find are raised and recorded.
Ideally, you should aim to open source the resulting projects, and pushing them to your own GitHub accounts is absolutely fine.

After you decide the project you'll be working on, get in touch with the Operations team, in Flowdock, and let them know what you'll be needing (hardware/software/other components) to make it happen.

## Project Photos / Videos / Information

If you take any photos / videos during your project development (and you most likely should take some!), upload it to [Google Drive / FridayHacks](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2Os9XLYS_LZY2s4X1FWM2lLems) so it can be shared easier. Thank you! Would love to be able to publish our hacks through the blog, hackster, your own blog, etc...
