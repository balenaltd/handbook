# Hack Fridays
Hack Fridays started with the idea of every Friday being a company-wide hackathon for balena. You are encouraged to use every Friday to hack away, test, learn and create fun projects that can be shared. However, as balenistas were finding it tricky to free up every Friday for hacking, we now have a Hack Friday event noted in the calendar for every Friday of the no scheduled calls week (roughly once a month) to encourage everyone to join. So, for Hack Friday instead of your regularly scheduled tasks, you can work on a project of your choosing, though it must meet the following conditions:

1. It uses balena, or can attempt to break the security of balena, or can be a tool built using balena-sdk or balena-API or other balena components.
1. You can't use special privileges to code the project, you should not even have your balena developer environment running on Friday (i.e. any external user must be able to build the same project)
1. You must declare what project you'll be working on, on Flowdock -`s/projects`-, either before the end of your Thursday or at the morning of the hack day.
1. At the end of the day youâ€™re expected to file bug reports for any bugs you ran into and write a short paragraph of your experience with balena. You can find some ideas regarding feedback on our ["Live the balena user experience"](https://github.com/balena-io/balena/wiki/Live-the-balena-user-experience) wiki page.
1. The project should be reasonably scoped, although it does not have to be finished in one hack day and can stretch over 3 or 4 Fridays. Ideally, each hack day project should result in a nice github repo link and for awesome ones we will write a blog post about them.

The goal is to both get a feeling for our users' experience/pain, as well as to produce fun projects which our users can build themselves - it's easy to forget the big picture when working on day-to-day tasks and this work helps compensate for that.

An additional benefit is that we get to test new functionalities and file bug reports as we actually work with the platform, so ensure that any problems you find are raised and recorded.

**Important note**: Ideally, you should aim to open source the resulting projects, and make sure you push them to [balena playground](https://github.com/balena-io/balena/wiki/Github) where we keep a collection of play around projects for balena IoT devices.

If you require more hardware, software or other components for your Hack Firday project, get in touch with the Operations team in Flowdock using @@operations, #order, and the `t/operations` flow to let them know what you need to make it happen and remember to mention that these are for your Hack Friday project. 

## Project Photos / Videos / Information

If you take any photos / videos during your project development (and you most likely should take some!), upload it to [Google Drive / FridayHacks](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2Os9XLYS_LZY2s4X1FWM2lLems) so it can be shared easier. Thank you! Would love to be able to publish our hacks through the blog, hackster, your own blog, etc...
