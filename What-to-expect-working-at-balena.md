You should expect to **work on projects that are challenging**, and that push you to the edges of your ability in some dimension. We expect you to take that challenge seriously and work hard to overcome it.

You should expect to **encounter projects that keep getting more difficult** and challenge your abilities more and more. We expect you to let us know if this isn't the case.

You should **not expect to have an easy job**, one you can coast at and achieve good results at without focusing on getting it right.

You should expect to **fail often**. If you're not failing often enough, you are not being challenged enough. Failing should be a sign that you’re heading towards success.
 
You should also expect to **be able to control the kind of work you do**, at some degree. Many people who work for balena don't do today what they were originally hired to do, and the company itself isn't doing what it started out to do. Once you get into it, you often find you can be more effective doing something else than what you originally intended. We expect you will work harder and better when given a task you are excited about, so everyone wins when you're well matched to the task you're doing. The challenges you receive will not always be where you are strong. If you are a great engineer, you may be challenged on communication. If you are a great communicator, you may be challenged on technical understanding. While specialisation is important, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. You can make things more challenging. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or for guidance from other team members, to overcome the challenges that you face. You are free to set higher bars to success than the ones initially set for you.

This is what we aspire to offer to everyone on the team. If you are not receiving these things, you should tell the people who guide your work. If these are not things you want, you should think hard whether this is the company you want to be working for. We want to work together on improving the product as well as reaching your personal goals.

### Resources that can help you communicate at balena
As a distributed team, much of our communication happens in written form, with some higher bandwidth discussions over call/video as well. It's extremely important that we all communicate clearly with one another, and work on honing our writing and speaking skills. The team has started a list of resources that might be helpful if you're looking for ways to improve those skills. Contributions welcome!
