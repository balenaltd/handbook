## Brainstorm calls 

Brainstorm calls are core to how we work and reflect our approach for finding the highest-possible quality answer to the issues we face. You can read more about the brainstorm! game [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHb-D2vJxufa8OZPU55V5WBIXuQ44MNL4fcXw52lEe8/edit#). Brainstorm calls are scoped by loop and type. 

### Brainstorm types
* `product` for questions around `what` we want to do (i.e. what can be done to reduce a certain kind of friction for users)
* `architecture` for `how` questions, such as “how should a certain feature be implemented”

### Examples of these are: 
* balena.io architecture call
* balena.io product call
* LoopMVP arch call
* LoopMVP product call
> _Note: There are separate pages for the balena.io architecture and product calls in the meetings section and you can find more information about LoopMVP in the Work In Progress section._

### Loop specific brainstorm calls 
We also have brainstorm calls scoped by loop and these often include both `architecture` and `product` discussions. These are:

## How to raise an item for a brainstorm call
Each brainstorm call has a hashtag which when used on FD along with a short description of the problem and possibly a suggested solution to be discussed, your message will be sent to the relevant Front inbox where all items are collected to form the brainstorm call agenda. Read the hashtag section in the [Flowdock guide](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Flowdock) to get more information and see some examples.
