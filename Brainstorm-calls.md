## Brainstorm calls 

Brainstorm calls are core to how we work and reflect our approach for finding the highest-possible quality answer to the issues we face. You can read more about the brainstorm! game [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHb-D2vJxufa8OZPU55V5WBIXuQ44MNL4fcXw52lEe8/edit#). Brainstorm calls are scoped by loop and type. 

### Brainstorm types
* `product` for questions around `what` we want to do (i.e. what can be done to reduce a certain kind of friction for users)
* `architecture` for `how` questions, such as “how should a certain feature be implemented”
### Examples of these are: 
* balena.io architecture call
* balena.io product call
* LoopMVP arch call
* LoopMVP product call

### Loop specific brainstorm calls 
We also have brainstorm scoped by loop which will include both `product` and `architecture` questions. These are:
* companyOS brainstorm
* teamOS brainstorm
* balenaLabs brainstorm
* commercial brainstorm
* outreach brainstorm
