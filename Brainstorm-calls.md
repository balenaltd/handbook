# Brainstorm calls 

Brainstorm calls are core to how we work and reflect our approach for finding the highest-possible quality answer to the issues we face. You can read more about the **brainstorm!** game [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHb-D2vJxufa8OZPU55V5WBIXuQ44MNL4fcXw52lEe8/edit#). Brainstorm calls are scoped by loop and type. 

## Brainstorm types
* `product` for questions around `what` we want to do (i.e. what can be done to reduce a certain kind of friction for users)
* `architecture` or `arch` for `how` questions, such as “how should a certain feature be implemented”

## How to raise an item for a brainstorm call
Each brainstorm call has a hashtag which when used on FD along with a short description of the problem and possibly a suggested solution to be discussed. Your message will create a Jellfish brainstorm topic card and given the appropriate category (i.e. loop). Read the hashtag section in the [Flowdock guide](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Flowdock) to get more information and see some examples. Make sure that Hubot is added in the flow for hashtags to work and although you can use any hashtag in any flow, it is always better to raise a brainstorm using the relevant flow to generate valuable discussions, eg. using #commercial in the r/commercial flow. Sometimes there are more flows that seem relevant to raise a brainstorm item or a flow might be invite-only if it contains sensitive information, so you can decide what makes more sense! You can type `Hubot, show me your hashtags` to see the active hashtags you can use.
