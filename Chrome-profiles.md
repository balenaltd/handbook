Google has introduced the Sign in to Chrome feature to Google Chrome users. 
> When you sign in to the Chrome browser, you can save and sync things like your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other settings to your Google Account, so you can get to them on any device.

> You should only sign in to Chrome from trusted computers. To keep your data safe, we recommend you don't sign in if you're on a public computer.

Signing in to Google Chrome with your @balena.io e-mail address will help you create a profile with settings, bookmarks etc that are connected to your job and keep all your balena interests organized.
