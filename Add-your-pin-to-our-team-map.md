We are a distributed team working from all around the world! Our marketing site has a [team page](https://www.balena.io/team/) with a map that represents all the balenistas based across the world and you can help us keep this up to date by adding your own pin :) 

To add your pin, visit [balena.io/admin](https://balena.io/admin) and log in with your Github account. You can see "Team members" on the sidebar to list all the team members and there is a button to add new team members. If you want to edit a team member's pin (eg. you have moved to another city) you can open the team member's card, make changes, and save. There is also a delete button at the top if you wish to remove a team member. Once you save your changes, a PR is created for you, which you can self certify to merge it. 

Please note that you can't include the degrees symbol or N/S/E/W in your lat/long entry on the /admin site. It will have to be in the (-)00.00000 format, negative indicating S or W.
