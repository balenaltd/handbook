We are a distributed team working from all around the world! Our marketing site has a [team page](https://www.balena.io/team/) with a map that represents all the balenistas based across the world and you can help us keep this up to date by adding your own pin :) 

To add your pin, visit [balena.io/admin](https://balena.io/admin) and log in with your Github account. You can see "Team members" on the sidebar to list all the team members and there is a button to add new team members. If you want to edit a team member's pin (eg. you have moved to another city) you can open the team member's card, make changes, and save. There is also a delete button at the top if you wish to remove a team member. Once you save your changes, a PR is created for you on [Github](https://github.com/pulls), which you can self-certify to merge it. You can self-approve your PR by commenting @balena-ci I self-certify! on your PR, since you don't need a second pair of eyes for this one! Please follow [these guidelines](https://github.com/people-os/process/blob/master/process/Commit_and_PR_Guidelines.md#commit-guidelines) for commits and PRs. 

You will need to go to flowdock's @@t/operations channel and request #access to people-os to see the above Balena git guidelines doc.

Please note that you can't include the degrees symbol or N/S/E/W in your lat/long entry on the /admin site. It will have to be in the (-)00.00000 format, negative indicating S or W.
