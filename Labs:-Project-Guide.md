# What is it?
A project guide is a mentor, or a guide, for how to build projects, collect and submit product feedback, and publicise your work. A guide will have likely spent some time in the balena labs themselves, and will have built projects before.

# What do they do?
A guide is the project builder's "go to" for questions about how to build their project. They answer questions like:
* what makes a good project?
* what is a valid project idea?
* how do I get some hardware?
* how do we enable network effects?
* how do we test a project?
* how do I go about writing a blog post?

A project builder and a guide will typically catch up once a week (or more if they want) to chat through the project, where it has got to, and what is next. The guide will guide the project builder in the best way to use the balena team to solve issues and find out information. They are versed in the tools that balena use, such as the various flows in flowdock, finding documents in Google Drive and how to use Jellyfish.

# What do they not do?
It is not the guide's role to solve technical problems for the project builder. If the project builder has a question, and the guide knows the answer: great! But it is not the guide's job to find answers to technical questions they don't know themselves. The labs brainstorm is one place for these questions to be asked. The project builder can also use the t/beginners flow to ask the team for help. By helping the project builder use calls and flows to find solutions to their issues, the guide is guiding them into meeting more people and accessing the techniques they will use beyond their time in labs.

The guide doesn't have to pair program or help debug issues with the project code. Again, they can if they want, but it's not a mandatory part of the role.

The guide doesn't have to test the finished project - although it would be a nice thing to do. ;)

# How long should it take?
If the project builder is a new joiner to balena, then they will also have a balena buddy for all of the broader questions about working here. So the guide role should be project-specific. As such it should take no longer than an hour per week, unless they want to get more involved.
