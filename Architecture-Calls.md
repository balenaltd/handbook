## Description

Architecture calls take place several times a week (usually 2 or 3). It is the time and (virtual) place where we generally try to come up with an action plan to tackle non-trivial technical issues across the resin.io platform. This call is usually technically oriented and the subjects range from resin.io backend, devices, cli tools etc. Everyone from the resin.io team is welcome to join.

### Using the #architecture Flowdock tag

Many interesting technical discussions often produce very long threads that are difficult to follow. There are no hard-defined rules on when a Flowdock thread should be discussed in an architecture call, but if you think it should, please tag the thread by adding a comment with the `#architecture` tag **and** a small summary. The reason is that Hubot picks these `#architecture`-tagged comments up and sends them to the `architecture` FrontApp inbox, which largely forms our next meeting agenda.
