## Description

Architecture calls take place several times a week (usually 2 or 3). It is the time and (virtual) place where we generally try to come up with an action plan to tackle non-trivial technical issues across the resin.io platform. This call is usually technically oriented and the subjects range from resin.io backend, devices, cli tools etc. Everyone from the resin.io team is welcome to join.

### Using the #architecture Flowdock tag

Many interesting technical discussions often produce very long threads that are difficult to follow, so what we do  instead is have a call, keep meeting minutes and come up with an action plan. There are no hard-defined rules on when a Flowdock thread should be discussed in an architecture call, but if you think it should, please tag the thread by adding a comment with the `#architecture` tag **and** a small summary. The reason is that Hubot picks these `#architecture`-tagged comments up and sends them to the `architecture` FrontApp inbox, which largely forms our next meeting agenda.

## Pinned Agenda Items

* Supervisor rearchitecture
* ENM/resinup/supervisor fusion

## Recent Meeting Notes

### 26 Jan 2017

#### Attendees: Petros, Shaun, Andrei, Alexis, Kostas
#### resinOS 2.x - schedule and remaining items

* [resinOS devices dual boot partition](https://beta.frontapp.com/inboxes/shared/d_architecture/all/211384242)
  * **Action:** We are moving forward with dual partition for Rpi device types only
* [rootfs sizes](https://beta.frontapp.com/inboxes/shared/d_architecture/all/211384242)
  * **Action:** Will move forward with [Theodor's proposal](https://github.com/resin-os/resinos/issues/126)
* [image deployment](https://beta.frontapp.com/inboxes/shared/d_architecture/all/211707638)
  * Context
    * We need a deployment method that will handle all 4 types of resin images and decide on things like s3 structure. This is an open issue that we've been discussing at least since mid-November
    * There's a possible blocker/clash with the ongoing etcher/resin backend discussion
  * **Action:** This task requires Jenkins-specific modifications that Trong will lead
* Enumerated possible resinHUP frameworks like swupdates/mender
  * **Action:** Needs investigation/task leader
* Discussed resinOS ssh/docker socket security hardening
  * Context
    * Atm ssh is passwordless and Docker socket is exposed
  * Notes
    * It's still not clear how we should move forward with this. We discussed the possibility of extending `rdt` to support adding SSH keys into the image. The exposed Docker socket is also an issue because it provides unauthenticated access and even with SSH keys, one can simply create a container that binds to / and gain root access. Also, we have to carefully consider blocking Docker socket access because a) we already use it in some example projects b) there's no easy way for users to use `docker` and `docker-compose` over SSH so they'll be 'locked' to `rdt`
* [self-service resinHUP improvements](https://beta.frontapp.com/inboxes/shared/d_architecture/all/211723016)
  * Notes
    * Currently resinHUP is restricted to versions that are safe to use (`1.x` and `>=1.16.0` only) . If we open it up to more versions we'll need to improve the warning/info message before the update - users should *first* test their app to the target os version they want to update to.
    * Discussed on improving resinHUP progress. The most time-consuming operations atm are `docker pull`'s and reporting progress updates while these are running is hard. There's still no clear way forward.
    * Also discussed coupling OS with supervisor updates. The main reason why we updated supervisor separately is that the OS update was hard. This is changing with self-serve hostOS updates, which brings us closer to melding supervisor into the OS. We also discussed which supervisor versions/tags should be fetched during the update (it shouldn't be the `latest` tag but one that is guaranteed to work with the particular OS version)

  * **[Action item]:** Bluetooth/nodejs related issue that needs more research (Joe)

===

### 20 Dec 2016

* BBB image that boots from SD card (needs to autoboot, can't require button press) served from the dashboard
  * ~~**[Action item]:** Write spec~~ https://github.com/resin-io/hq/pull/521 https://github.com/resin-io/hq/pull/520
* Discuss how the hostname should be set in resin2.0 (resinOS or base images) Also the hostname format, the current format is <device-type>-<short UUID> but resinOS2.0 uses only <short UUID>
  * **[Action item]:** More investigation needed on how changing the hostname from the container affects the host OS one (are they shared or not?)
  * **[Action item]:** Detect if we're running a recent OS and if so, do not change the hostname from the base image. The advertised hostname can be either <device-type>-<shortUUID> or resin-<uuid> (TBD)
* rdt promote
  * **[Action item]:** Reiterate on the idea of users having their own openvpn server + ability to do openssh connection on the device, essentially a proxy - as part of resinOS story there'd be a resinOS control server, which basically is vpn and ssh that they can use to get into the devices. We could provide an easy to set up openvpn/command&control server (e.g. for aws) and also have a deployment guide on how to get to production and the steps to get access to the devices (using the provided resinos control server)
  * **[Action item]:** Create spec on preparing preloaded images from a simple server
* Update strategies
  * **[Action item]:** Continue work on document on data model for multicontainer/multiapp for GE
* Deltas mad science and resumable deltas
  * **[Action item]:** Need to think more about resumable deltas and consider configurable timeouts
* Decide whether to go ahead with https://github.com/resin-io/resin-supervisor/pull/273/files (making the supervisor ignore resinhup images - which has a bit of an ugly hardcoding)
  * ~~**[Action item]:** We can pass for now~~ PR closed - https://github.com/resin-io/resin-supervisor/pull/273#issuecomment-268359835
