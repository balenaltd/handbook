Our users spend a lot of time using resin.io. We must make their experience as pleasant as possible and help them get the most out of our service. 

Day 1 will be dedicated to using resin.io as a user. You’ll be required to sign up, and create a project with resin. Live what our users live, get in their shoes! In this journey we need you to act exactly as a user would act. Follow our getting started guide, go through our docs, contact the support team, deploy code to a device (physical or virtual) etc. If you don't have development skills to deploy code yet, make sure to tell us where our signup and setup fails or confuses you.

It’s really important that you take notes of anything good or bad, anything that helped you and anything you found difficult, anything that got you excited and any flaws you found. You’ll be requested to share your notes/thoughts with the Experience team, in Flowdock or during a call. Your first day is a unique time, one where you’re relatively unbiased about the product, and we want to make sure we get the most honest and detailed feedback we can.
