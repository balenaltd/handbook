## Background
At balena, "the loop" is our very own framework for continuously improving products, so a "Product Builder" is the term we came up with, in an attempt to define the genotype for our product, the profile of the balenista we should all aspire to! It is a question we asked ourselves and have spent considerable time shaping the concept of the Product Builder. 

## The problem
Looking through the lifecycle of a company right from the start, the founders are soon exposed to commercial (financials, execution risk, demand..) and technical (technology, customers, supply..) uncertainties. As the company grows, it is hard to maintain the same amount of high-level context combined with low-level understanding for every team member to stay equally motivated and involved. Therefore, we traditionally see the addition of "management" layers that are directly exposed to commercial uncertainty and soon push the direct contributors away from it, keeping them exposed to just technical uncertainty. This gap can inevitably block team members from zooming out to converge on the shared vision and priorities, while it adds a new type of uncertainty for everyone, which we can call “political” uncertainty (deadlines, reviews, status, salary..). 

## Our solution
So what if, we create a company made up of people who are in touch with both commercial and technical uncertainties, even as it scales? Anyone can experience more or less from one or the other depending on their work/role but nobody is completely abstracted away, and everybody has at least some of both of the high-level vision and the low-level understanding of what they are building. So let's create a group of Product Builders! Product Builders are placed at the very center of the company having clear visibility to internal and external elements that make up the company and its mission. Supported by a shared infrastructure (productOS), they are able to make meaningful contributions focusing on their own growth, share knowledge to strengthen the team and support each other to progress, as well as continue adding value and having a positive impact on our common vision and goals. 

## Key questions 
### What is a Product:
* A solution to a problem. Satisfies a want or need for a particular user.
* A solution that scales to any user with the same want or need (not custom). 
* Has a clear boundary and function - exists as a digestible unit. 
* Interacts and combines with other products through defined surfaces / APIs. 
* Can be swapped with other products that address the same problem.
* Others?  

### Why is building Products (vs. other things) important?
* Scale. Solve a problem once, then move on new problems. 
* User-focused. Solve real problems faced by real users. 
* Enablement. Help others who have the same problem as you. 
* Clean interfaces. Allow what we build to apply in many environments. 
* Feedback loops. Create products, get feedback, improve products, repeat.
* Other reasons? 

### What is a Builder? 
* Somebody who constructs something by putting parts or materials together over a period of time
* Somebody who takes pride in their work and has a desire to hone their craft
* Somebody who has an internal motivation to create 
* Somebody who develops understanding through doing and learning
* Others? 

### What is a Product Builder?
* Somebody who Builds Products 
* Somebody who puts the Personal Loop into practice  

### What does the Personal Loop look like in practice?
* Step 1: Observe user feedback
* Step 2: Reflect and identify patterns
* Step 3: Brainstorm and design a solution
* Step 4: Implement and deploy a solution
* Step 5: Repeat 

### What principles define a Product Builder genotype?
* Mission alignment
* Ownership
* Short term pain for long term gain 
* First principles thinking
* Root cause problem solving
* Zero to one creativity 
* Self-reflection
* Pursue the truth
* Optimize for understanding
* Continuous improvement 
* Adaptability 
* Open-mindedness
* Self-motivation
* Clear and direct communication

### How do I level up as a Product Builder? 
* Live in the personal loop - reflect, reflect, reflect
* Solve increasingly difficult problems at higher levels of abstraction
* Enable the team to do more with fewer resources 
* Practice and hone the Product Builder principles 
* Help others become better Product Builders
