## Introduction
At balena, "the loop" is our framework for continuously improving products. Being a "Product Builder" means using the loop to build and improve products. A Product Builder is the profile of an ideal balenista that we all aspire to. 

To be successful at balena is therefore to continuously become a better Product Builder. No matter what you’re doing, whether your strength is in operations, commercial, engineering, finance, distribution, hardware, software, support, or elsewhere, we are all leveraging our unique skills and domain expertise to build better products. And not just the obvious products we build for our users, but the products, processes, and experiences we build for ourselves as well. Each and every team member at balena is therefore an aspiring Product Builder. 

Together, Balena is a collective of Product Builders honing our craft. We are helping each other and sharing our knowledge along the way. We are expanding our understanding by trying many different things and learning from the results. We are open to failing and disagreeing if it helps us improve. We are constantly updating our collective intelligence and providing one another with mutual assistance. We are all aware of the external realities and broader context we operate in, and are also familiar with the details of what, exactly, we are building. We are confident and curious, aware of our limitations but also how to circumvent them. We are motivated to solve harder and harder problems, and to use the knowledge gained to build valuable products for ourselves and for our users - to build things that have never been built before. 

We think that creating a company of product builders is the best way to achieve our mission. We also think it’s the best way to build a scalable, antifragile, omni-win-win organization where work is fulfilling, engaging, and meaningful. 

## Key questions 
### What is a Product:
* A solution to a problem. Satisfies a want or need for a particular user.
* A solution that scales to any user with the same want or need (not custom). 
* Has a clear boundary and function - exists as a digestible unit. 
* Interacts and combines with other products through defined surfaces / APIs. 
* Can be swapped with other products that address the same problem.

### Why is building Products (vs. other things) important?
* Scale. Solve a problem once, then move on new problems. 
* User-focused. Solve real problems faced by real users. 
* Enablement. Help others who have the same problem as you. 
* Clean interfaces. Allow what we build to apply in many environments. 
* Feedback loops. Create products, get feedback, improve products, repeat.

### What is a Builder? 
* Somebody who constructs something by putting parts or materials together over a period of time
* Somebody who takes pride in their work and has a desire to hone their craft
* Somebody who has an internal motivation to create 
* Somebody who develops understanding through doing and learning

### What is a Product Builder?
* Somebody who Builds Products (duh :p)
* Somebody who puts the Personal Loop into practice  

### What does the Personal Loop look like in practice?
* Step 1: Observe user feedback
* Step 2: Reflect and identify patterns
* Step 3: Brainstorm and design a solution
* Step 4: Implement and deploy a solution
* Step 5: Repeat 

### What principles define a Product Builder?
* Mission alignment
* Ownership
* Short term pain for long term gain 
* First principles thinking
* Root cause problem solving
* Zero to one creativity 
* Self-reflection
* Pursue the truth
* Optimize for understanding
* Continuous improvement 
* Adaptability 
* Open-mindedness
* Self-motivation
* Clear and direct communication

### How do I level up as a Product Builder? 
* Live in the personal loop - reflect, reflect, reflect
* Solve increasingly difficult problems at higher levels of abstraction
* Enable the team to do more with fewer resources 
* Practice and hone the Product Builder principles 
* Help others become better Product Builders 


## Why is building a company of Product Builders so important? 

To help illustrate what it means to be a Product Builder and why it’s important, let’s follow the lifecycle of a company. 

When the company first starts, the team consists only of the founders. The founders are all direct contributors, and therefore directly experience all of the technical uncertainty and nitty-gritty details that come with building a new product. The founders are also the only interface to the external world, so they are directly exposed to the commercial uncertainty of raising funds, acquiring customers, etc. 

Hopefully the company finds some early success and continues to grow, adding more team members beyond the initial founders. The hope is that all new team members will be as equally motivated and involved as the initial founders.

But of course, [this rarely happens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem), and instead the organization begins to resemble something more like a traditional hierarchy. Here, the “management” layer is exposed to commercial uncertainty, and individual contributors are exposed to technical uncertainty. In an attempt to bridge this gap and “protect” the rest of the team from commercial uncertainty, more and more layers of management are introduced, and a new type of uncertainty, let’s call it “political” uncertainty, is introduced.

This new layer of management and political uncertainty abstracts away the commercial uncertainty and external realities from the team, and abstracts away the technical uncertainty and implementation details from management. This layer adds review, deadlines, and all sorts of other distortions in order to ensure the direct contributors are engaged and productive on a constant basis. At the same time, management gets removed from the hard realities of product development, and becomes increasingly focused on concepts that aren’t connected to the reality on the ground. 

This also introduces tension between management and direct contributors. Management feels that they are taking on a heavy burden on behalf of the rest of the team, that they bear all the external risk and stress in order to keep the team productive, but meanwhile they don't actually have the opportunity to produce anything themselves, and thus lose touch with what it feels like to be a direct contributor. Direct contributors, on the other hand, have the opportunity to build things, but can get disconnected from the broader mission and context, and may feel like their work is not appreciated. They start getting a feeling that management has no idea what’s going on and what actually matters, and develop a sense that things could be done better, even if it's not clear to them how. Everybody feels misunderstood, hurt, and emotionally exhausted, and aren’t even able to speak the same language. Sounds… less than ideal. 
 
### Our solution
What if, instead, we abandon the concept of abstracting one or the other group away from any kind of uncertainty? What if we create a company made up of people who are in touch with both commercial and technical uncertainties, even as it scales? Anyone can experience more or less from one or the other depending on their work/role but nobody is completely abstracted away, and everybody has at least some of both of the high-level vision and the low-level understanding of what they are building. So let's create a group of Product Builders! Product Builders are placed at the very center of the company having clear visibility to internal and external elements that make up the company and its mission. Supported by a shared infrastructure (productOS), they are able to make meaningful contributions focusing on their own growth, share knowledge to strengthen the team and support each other to progress, as well as continue adding value and having a positive impact on our common vision and goals.
