Given the fact that our team is distributed to more than 15 countries and in different timezones, gathering the whole team together for drinks and discussion is not so easy. That’s how the idea of the virtual happy hour was created. This is a bi-weekly event, every other Friday at the moment (see Google calendar for more information). Let’s grab a real beer, a coke, a mint tea or whatever you fancy drinking and join the virtual happy hour event to chill and chat with other team members. Of course, rules apply here:
* Attendance is 100% optional. Show up whenever you want, leave whenever you want. 
* You must have your video turned on.
* You can't be doing work while you are here. No multitasking allowed.
