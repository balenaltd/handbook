Being a remote-first team, we value everything that can help us stay connected and have more face-to-face interaction, so we are putting a lot of effort into simplifying and maintaining the remote working culture, making it as easy and friendly for balenistas. Thus, we'd like to ask you to upload a photo to the everyday services you will be using, such as your @balena.io e-mail and Flowdock. You can use the same photo you use for your social media profiles, as long as it is an actual photo of you and as normal as possible! We also encourage everyone to have their cameras on for the all-hands calls and any other smaller meetings you will be interacting with balenistas, so we can all put a face on those usernames :) 

**Quick advice before we move on to the specifics**: Once you join Flowdock, you will be introduced to the team by the balenista assisting your onboarding and the welcome pings will start coming your way! Take the opportunity to introduce yourself to everyone and tell us a little bit about you. You will find more information about Flowdock and a guide further down the wiki, but you might want to have a quick look [here](https://www.flowdock.com/help/chat) and [here](http://archive.is/xVcjA) and read about conversation threads and re-threading. Threading is something that all new balenistas who are not familiar with Flowdock get wrong, so don't worry if it gets you some time to get it right :)
