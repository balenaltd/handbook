One of the e-mails you received from balena on your starting day should be the invitation to create your @balena.io e-mail account. Following the instructions in the e-mail you should have set up your e-mail account. Please note that your @balena.io e-mail account is to be used mainly for external communication as we’re using other tools for internal communication, as much as we can.

### Signature

You might need to contact users, vendors etc. via e-mail. We encourage you to add a signature to your e-mails, with the following information:

* Full name
* Job position
* Company name (linking to website)
* Personal or company Twitter account

It may be a good idea for those of the team members who do support, to avoid adding their phone number in the signature. Finally, with regards to the address, if you need to add one, please add the address of the office you work for or the headquarters if you're a contractor. DO NOT add your personal address.

Here’s an example:

_Apostolis C. Michalakos_ <br>
_Operations Manager, Balena <br> 
_mo: +30 6946 91 3376_ <br>
_twt: @balena_io_ <br>

Please note that the e-mail signature will soon be updated to a much better form.
