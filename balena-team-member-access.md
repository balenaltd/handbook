**balena team member access** means that you have access to certain user applications. Itâ€™s really useful when you provide customer support. In addition, in order to have accurate analytics reporting, we need to tag our usernames that are utilized internally for development or testing purposes. We already filter out users with our balena email addresses (@balena.io). In case you need to utilize an account with non-balena email address, contact Operations with your username to get the team_member role added to your account. 

You will probably have a balena account linked to your personal email as well and we want to make sure that it is clear to everyone which account they should use for what. See below: 

balena-cloud.com: personal email account for non-work projects OR for testing balenaOS releases
balena-cloud.com: @balena.io email account for support ONLY
staging.balena-cloud.com: @balena.io email account for testing new balenaCloud features OR testing balenaOS releases on staging
