You will soon be allocated a "buddy" and the balenista assisting with your onboarding will make sure you are introduced. Your buddy is a balenista that has been at balena for a while and can give you more background and insight about how we work at balena, as well as answer any questions you may have while you are settling in. Your buddy might not have all the answers but they will be able to direct you to the right resources and people when needed or help you look for the information you need. 

Feel free to reach out to your buddy, schedule your first video call and agree on how this can work for both. We try to keep the buddying as informal and flexible as possible to make sure you use it in a way that suits you and your buddy, as well as helps you to settle in. As an example, some will agree on weekly video calls to go through questions and chat about how things work at balena and how you are settling in, while others will have ad-hoc ones more or less frequently. Your buddy should be a useful resource for your first few months at balena and make you feel welcome and supported. It is likely that your buddy will be someone that you would not normally work and interact with on a regular basis, so take the opportunity to connect and learn about the different projects they might be working on, even if these are outside your area of work and expertise!
