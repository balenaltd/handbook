## Feedback *to* resin

We're using TinyPulse as one way to ask and receive feedback about how you're doing, about how things are going, and provide a place to bring up anything you want to. It's a place to share the triumphs you're seeing -- share that dopamine hit with the rest of us! And, while we're a small company we think it's important that we have an anonymous way to share, because it’s important to be able to raise problems you see, without worry about how it reflects on you.

As always, this is an experiment -- we'll adjust how we're using this app as we figure out how it's useful to us. If a feature has other options for how we use/share the feedback, it's noted in this documentation.

Currently, Sonya is the only admin, and thus the only person who can see survey or suggestion text responses.

## TinyPulse features

### Surveys
Weekly surveys show up in your email Wednesday by 11am GMT. There's only one question, and there's a text box for optional elaboration (which is always super helpful to hear). We've set up TinyPulse to publish the aggregate, anonymous results graph for each question -- though not the text box responses. (We could share these, so if you think that's a good idea, please mention it!)

Here are ways you can help make resin feedback successful:
* Participate: commit to responding to the TINYpulse question (it takes less than 2 minutes!) -- the more folks who answer, the better idea we have of the state of our team.
* Lead with solutions: be constructive with your comments and suggestions. Express your frustrations and concerns, and try to consider tangible solutions that would improve things.
* Respond to private messages: If you receive private messages from administrators, it is because they truly want to address your feedback, but they need more information, context, and discussion to properly proceed. **You remain anonymous throughout the entire private message conversation.**

### Suggestions
These are anonymous messages you can send, to share any feedback you'd like to. This is a free text box you can always access (log into TinyPulse to find it). 

### Cheers for Peers
Since we don't have a way to mention "hey, good job with that project" while passing each other in the hallway, Cheers are a way to provide a way to give kudos to each other. Honestly, this is a default feature of TinyPulse, so we're just going to kind of go with it and see what happens. Currently, only the person sent a Cheers will see it (so it's like the hallway scenario), though we could opt to make all Cheers public (more like a Facebook-style wall). 

**Cheers for Peers are not anonymous by default**, but anonymous option can be selected. Admins can not see anonymous cheers. The two requirements for Cheers are to specify a recipient and write a message.

## Notes
Some of this information is straight-up taken from TinyPulse's intro slide deck for employees, [which you can read all of here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mqEpEpfpxTL8HrW4M6wEoJvcU8YLv7auRoqCSoUkt8k/edit#slide=id.p16).

### How TinyPulse is anonymous
Both your survey responses and suggestions are completely anonymous. Only admins have access to see the text you add to your survey response, and can private message you in response to your comments/suggestions. They do not know who you are, and you remain anonymous if you decide to respond back.
* Your responses in one week are not associated to those in other weeks
* Filters can be created associated with attributes about you, but results won’t show up until at least 5 people of the same filter have responded (we can't figure out who you are by filters)
