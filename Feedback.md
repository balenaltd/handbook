## Feedback *to* balena

We value feedback and we are working on making it a core part of our culture. Feedback can help us learn and improve, so we encourage all balenistas to use every opportunity to give candid feedback to teammates. We do not use formal processes so feedback should be part of any conversation that feels appropriate. Feedback should be a two way communication and you should feel comfortable asking for it when you feel you are not receiving enough. We also want to hear your feedback about your experience as a balenista and look at ways to improve this experience! You can use **#teamfeedback** when you want to post any feedback on a structure or process. You can choose the relevant flow to post your feedback using **#teamfeedback** but remember to ensure that Hubot is added in that flow so your team feedback can be sent to the right place :)

We're also using TinyPulse as one way to ask and receive feedback about how you're doing, about how things are going, and provide a place to bring up anything you want to. It's a place to share the triumphs you're seeing -- share that dopamine hit with the rest of us! And, while we are a small team we think it's important that we have an anonymous way you can share your thoughts, feedback, and suggestions because it’s important to be able to raise problems you see, without worrying about how it reflects on you.

When new balenistas start and for the first few weeks, they receive a few (clearly labeled!) non-anonymous survey questions about how their onboarding is going. The non-anonymous onboarding questions are sent on week 1, 2, 4 & 12. We want to hear how your first weeks are going and how you have been settling in! 

As always, this is an experiment -- we'll adjust how we're using this app as we figure out how it's useful to us. If a feature has other options for how we use/share the feedback, it's noted in this documentation.

The strategy team can read the results, including all responses and suggestions from balenistas.

## TINYpulse features

### Surveys
Bi-weekly surveys show up in your inbox on Wednesday by 11am GMT. There's only one question, and there's a text box for optional elaboration (which is always super helpful to hear). We've set up TINYpulse to publish the aggregate, anonymous results graph for each question, so you will see this after you respond and can come back later once more teammates have responded -- though you cannot see the text box responses.

Feel free to add the [TINYpulse Gmail add-on](https://www.tinypulse.com/gmail), so you can just respond to the TINYpulse questions without leaving your inbox! 

Here are ways you can help make balena feedback successful:
* Participate: commit to responding to the TINYpulse question (it takes less than 1 minute!) -- the more balenistas answer, the better idea we have of the state of our team. If you don't tell us, we can't know! 
* Lead with solutions: be constructive with your comments and suggestions. Express your frustrations and concerns, and try to consider tangible solutions that would improve things. We want to hear your ideas and suggestions!
* Respond to private messages: If you receive private messages from administrators, it is because they truly want to address your feedback, but they need more information, context, and discussion to properly proceed. **You remain anonymous throughout the entire private message conversation.**

### Suggestions
These are anonymous messages you can send, to share any feedback, thoughts and ideas you'd like to. This is a free text box you can always access (log into TinyPulse to find it). The suggestions will usually be transferred to the AMA section of the upcoming All Hands call to be addressed. 

### Cheers for Peers
Since we don't have a way to mention "hey, good job with that project" while passing each other in the hallway, Cheers for Peers are a way to provide a way to give kudos to each other. Honestly, this is a default feature of TinyPulse, so we're just going to kind of go with it and see what happens. Currently, only the person sent a Cheers will see it (so it's like the hallway scenario), though we could opt to make all Cheers public (more like a Facebook-style wall). You can start by sending Cheers to balenistas that have supported you through your first few weeks :)

**Cheers for Peers are not anonymous by default**, but there's an option to make it anonymous. Admins can not see who sent anonymous cheers.

## Notes
Some of this information is straight-up taken from TinyPulse's intro slide deck for employees, [which you can read all of here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mqEpEpfpxTL8HrW4M6wEoJvcU8YLv7auRoqCSoUkt8k/edit#slide=id.p16).

### How TinyPulse is anonymous
Both your survey responses and suggestions are completely anonymous. Only admins have access to see the text you add to your survey response, and can private message you in response to your comments/suggestions. They do not know who you are, and you remain anonymous if you decide to respond back.
* Your responses in one week are not associated to those in other weeks
* Filters can be created associated with attributes about you, but results won’t show up until at least 5 people of the same filter have responded (we can't figure out who you are by filters)
