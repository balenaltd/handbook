# Leave Policy 
## Intro 
The balena paid leave policy is designed to give team members control and flexibility over managing their leave. It moves us to a system that is streaming, rather than arbitrarily batched. It should be easy to understand, simple for team members to manage, incentivize the right behavior, and be flexible to different preferences. Team members are granted a generous amount of paid leave to take the amount of leave that’s right for them, but not feel pressure to take more leave than they would prefer to. 

## Glossary
**Leave:** paid time off taken at a time that the team member chooses.  

**Bank:** the place where your leave is stored as you accumulate leave, and drawn from as you take leave.

**Cap:** the limit of leave days which you can accumulate in your bank.

**Balance:** the amount of leave you currently have in your bank.

**Payout:** what you will receive if you go over the cap.

**Anniversary Date:** your anniversary date of joining the company.

**Bonus Leave:** leave given to members of the team who have covered the night shift on support, for example.

**Team Members:** all full time members of the team at balena.

**Employees:** team members with full time employment contracts in UK/US/Italy/Greece.

## Policy Details
The policy is based on a “bank” system of accumulating and drawing down leave as described below. 
* On their first day at balena (or on their anniversary date prior to transitioning to the new policy), team members will start with a 12 day balance in their leave “bank.” 
* Team members will accumulate 2.5 days, which will be added to their balance on their “anniversary day” of the following month (this equates to 30 additional days per year). For example, if you started on the 14th of May, you will have your 2.5 days added on the 14th of each following month.
* Team members can accumulate and carry up to 50 days of leave - this is the “cap” on their bank balance. The balance never expires and there is no need to “rollover” from year to year. A full example of the bank system can be found in _**Appendix A**_.
* Any days accumulated over the 50 day cap will automatically be paid to team members the following month, at 70% of a normal working day’s pay. The calculator for the daily payout rate is: 
`Daily payout rate = 70% * annual salary / 52 weeks / 5 days`
* Bonus leave will also be included in your leave bank. For example, if you have accumulated 40 days “leave” but have also accumulated 10 days “bonus leave” this will be included in the same bank, and your total balance would be 50 days. Any leave you accumulate on top of these 50 days, whether it be standard or bonus leave, would be paid out as described above. 
* Team members can also “overdraw” their bank if circumstances require. For example, if a team member joins but has a long holiday planned within their first few months of being at balena, they can drop into a negative balance in their bank as needed. This creates an “IOU” that can be made up with future leave accumulation. For now, overdraws are limited to -10 days. If any team member leaves the company with a negative balance, this will be deducted from their final salary. 
* By default, leave requests will be “auto-approved.” Team members are responsible for communicating their upcoming leave with the rest of the team and making sure they are appropriately covered during their leave. Recommended notice for coverage would be at least a few days before if you cover a call or are a maintainer, 1 week for weekday support and where possible, 2 weeks for devops weekend rotations. For peak leave periods such as Summer and Christmas, as much notice as possible being given will help the team plan for this. Any requests over 10  business days may need to be approved by the strategy team to ensure sufficient coverage.
* All leave, regardless of the nature (business day, bank holiday, local public holiday etc.) will be drawn from the bank and “booked” as leave. It is the responsibility of employees in Greece, UK, USA and Italy to request and take their local public holidays as leave.
* Employees in Greece and Italy should always start January 1st of the new year with at least a 12 day balance in their bank. If any team members are entitled to more than 2.5 days/month per local legislation, their monthly accumulation rate will be increased to represent this. Minimum entitlements for Greece and Italy can be found in Appendix B
* Team members who want to take extended unpaid leave beyond their paid leave allocation should discuss this with a member of the strategy team. Unpaid leave will be considered on a case by case basis
* Part time contractors are not entitled to paid leave, but can book unpaid leave.
* When a team member leaves the company, they will be paid out for any unused leave in their bank 
* If a member of the team leaves the company before their first anniversary, or before the first anniversary of this policy being enacted, they will not be entitled to be paid out for the 12 day starting balance.

## Policy Explanation
By starting with a 12 day balance, new team members have a built-in buffer against overdraft, and are able to take any planned holiday without concern. In countries where local regulation dictates that employees take public holidays, such as Italy and Greece, these 12 days ensure that employees always have enough leave in the bank to take their public holidays. 

The adoption of the bank system removes the “use it or lose it” approach to managing leave. It provides the team with flexibility to build up and take leave when it suits them, or choose to be paid for unused leave days if they prefer to work rather than take all of their accumulated leave. The system provides a generous amount of leave for all team members, and goes above the minimum allowance required for any employees in countries with leave minimums. 

In the bank system, team members accumulate additional days for each month worked at balena, up to a cap. Above that cap, they are paid out at a percentage of their daily salary equivalent. That way, team members are not forced to take leave for fear of losing it; if they don’t want to take any more leave, they can be paid out instead. We pay at a discount, however, to incentivize people to use their leave first, and only take the payout if they believe that receiving an extra day’s pay at 70% is more valuable than the time off. 

“Bonus” days allocated to team members for things like night and weekend support shifts and on-call rotations are included within each team member’s leave bank to avoid the confusion of having two different “leave banks,” and to give the team flexibility to be paid out for this type of leave if they prefer, as they would with any other leave accumulated above their bank balance cap. 

It’s essential that all leave is booked in advance so that the rest of the team knows you are not working on a particular day. The request and approval process is more about creating a record of who’s out on a particular day than requiring approval, and most requests will be auto-approved. As most requests will be auto-approved, it’s important that the team members requesting leave ensure there will be enough coverage on the team for anything that may need to be done while they are gone. The notice periods above for communicating with other members of the team will ensure appropriate coverage for these tasks or responsibilities.The strategy team may need to look at individual requests that are over 10 business days before approving, to make sure we have appropriate coverage during your absence.

Employees in Italy & Greece should start each calendar year with 12 days in their bank to allow them to request their local and national holidays. In the rare case that an employee in Italy or Greece is entitled by law  to more leave than they are granted under this policy, they will have their accumulation rate increased from 2.5 days per month to represent this, so there is no need to add manual adjustments. 

We understand that team members may need to take a period of unpaid leave outside their paid leave allocation for various personal circumstances such as studying, travelling, looking after family etc. We want to be able to accommodate each individual team member as much as we can, and so will discuss this with each team member on a case by case basis to understand their needs, length of time they will need to be away, how we will cover this etc.

As part time contractors work variable hours each month and aren’t fully dedicated to balena in their activity, they are not entitled to paid leave, but can book unpaid leave in order to communicate their absence with the rest of the team.

If you leave the company before your first anniversary (or within one year after transitioning to the new policy), you will not be paid out for the 12 day starting balance. This is to ensure things are fair for team members and the company - if someone left after 1 month, for example, it wouldn’t be fair for them to be paid out for 14.5 days of accumulated leave. Think of it as these 12 days “maturing” after one year in the bank system.

### Appendix B: Greece and Italy leave requirements 
## Greece
Under Greek labour law, vacation days and public holidays are considered separately. The minimum vacation allowance is as follows:
| Years of Employment                     | Number of days |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| First year of employment in a company   | 20 days  |
| Second year of employment in a company  | 21 days  |
| Third year of employment in a company   | 22 days  |
| Ten years of employment in a company or twelve years working history           | 25 days  |
| Twenty-five years working history       | 26 days  |

Employees are also entitled to local and national public holidays, which will vary from year to year. For 2020, this amounts to 10 days which fall within the working week. Any employees who are entitled to more than 20 days vacation + 10 local/public holidays will have their 2.5 days/month accrual adjusted to represent this fact. 

## Italy

Under Italian Labor Law, vacation days and public holidays are considered separately. Employees are entitled to a minimum of 20 days vacation per year. Employees are also entitled to local and national public holidays, which will vary from year to year based on which holidays fall on a weekend. Any public holidays which fall on a Saturday or Sunday will be added to their monthly salary as an extra day’s pay and be visible on their payslip. For 2020, there are 8 public holidays that fall within the working week.
