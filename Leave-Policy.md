## Intro 
The balena paid leave policy is designed to give team members control and flexibility over managing their leave. It moves us to a system that is streaming, rather than arbitrarily batched. It should be easy to understand, simple for team members to manage, incentivize the right behavior, and be flexible to different preferences. Team members are granted a generous amount of paid leave to take the amount of leave that’s right for them, but not feel pressure to take more leave than they would prefer to. 

Leave days are available to the team for holidays, vacation etc. whilst we also have a [parental leave policy](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Parental-Leave-Policy) for team members who are expecting a new addition to their family. For days when you are not able to work due to illness or family emergencies, we have the [sick & personal leave policy](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Sick-&-Personal-Leave-Policy).

## Policy Details
The policy is based on a “bank” system of accumulating and drawing down leave as described below. 

* On their first day at balena (or on their anniversary date prior to transitioning to the new policy), team members will start with a 12 day balance in their leave “bank.”
* Team members will accumulate 2.5 days, which will be added to their balance on their “anniversary day” of the following month (this equates to 30 additional days per year). For example, if you started on the 14th of May, you will have your 2.5 days added on the 14th of each following month.
* The balance never expires and there is no need to “rollover” from year to year.
* Team members can accumulate and carry up to 80  days of leave -  there is a ‘soft cap’ and ‘hard cap’ on their bank balance. 
* The soft cap is reached at 40 days. On reaching the soft cap, team members can choose to either be paid out for any leave in their bank above  40 days, or continue accumulating leave in their bank.
* Team members are responsible for managing their own leave bank, and will be automatically paid out for anything above the soft cap unless they explicitly request to continue accumulating leave. As of now, team members can set their payout preferences in their personal  tab in the Team Model. TeamOS will review all balances on the last working day of the month, for the payouts to be actioned in the following payroll. Team members will receive an email at the end of each month notifying them they have reached the soft or hard cap.
* The hard cap is reached at 80  days. On reaching the hard cap, any leave in their bank above 80 days will be automatically paid out.
* If the soft cap is reached and a payout is actioned, or if the hard cap is reached and automatic payout is initiated, the team member will be paid out the following month, at 70% of a normal working day’s pay. The calculation for the daily payout rate is: `Daily payout rate = 70% * annual salary / 52 weeks / 5 days`
* Bonus leave will also be included in your leave bank. For example, if you have accumulated 30 days “leave” but have also accumulated 10 days “bonus leave” this will be included in the same bank, and your total balance would be 40 days. Any leave you accumulate on top of these 40 days, whether it be standard or bonus leave, would follow the same soft and hard cap conditions as described above.
* Team members can also “overdraw” their bank if circumstances require. For example, if a team member joins but has a long holiday planned within their first few months of being at balena, they can drop into a negative balance in their bank as needed. This creates an “IOU” that can be made up with future leave accumulation. For now, overdraws are limited to -10 days. If any team member leaves the company with a negative balance, this will be deducted from their final salary.
* By default, leave requests will be “auto-approved.” Team members are responsible for communicating their upcoming leave with the rest of the team and making sure they are appropriately covered during their leave. Recommended notice for coverage would be at least a few days before if you cover a call or are a maintainer, 1 week for weekday support and where possible, 2 weeks for devops weekend rotations. For peak leave periods such as Summer and Christmas, as much notice as possible being given will help the team plan for this. Any requests over 10 business days may need to be approved by the strategy team to ensure sufficient coverage.
* All leave, regardless of the nature (business day, bank holiday, local public holiday etc.) will be drawn from the bank and “booked” as leave. It is the responsibility of employees in Greece, UK, USA and Italy to request and take their local public holidays as leave.
* When a member of the team is expecting a new addition to their family, they will be granted an additional 12 weeks (60 days) to their leave bank to use however  suits them best. Full information on the Parental Leave policy can be found [here](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Parental-Leave-Policy)
* Employees in Greece and Italy should always start January 1st of the new year with at least a 12 day balance in their bank. If any team members are entitled to more than 2.5 days/month per local legislation, their monthly accumulation rate will be increased to represent this. Minimum entitlements for Greece and Italy can be found in **Appendix A**.
* Team members who want to take extended unpaid leave beyond their paid leave allocation should discuss this with a member of the strategy team. Unpaid leave will be considered on a case by case basis.
* Part time contractors are not entitled to paid leave, but can book unpaid leave.
* When a team member leaves the company, they will be paid out for any unused leave in their bank.
* If a member of the team leaves the company before their first anniversary, or before the first anniversary of this policy being enacted (June 1st 2021), the 12 day starting balance will automatically expire, and team members will not be able to request these days, nor will they be entitled to be paid out for them. If you have a negative leave balance on your last day, these days will be deducted from your final paycheck.


## Policy Explanation
By starting with a 12 day balance, new team members have a built-in buffer against overdraft, and are able to take any planned holiday without concern. In countries where local regulation dictates that employees take public holidays, such as Italy and Greece, these 12 days ensure that employees always have enough leave in the bank to take their public holidays.

The adoption of the bank system removes the “use it or lose it” approach to managing leave. It provides the team with flexibility to build up and take leave when it suits them, or choose to be paid for unused leave days if they prefer to work rather than take all of their accumulated leave. The system provides a generous amount of leave for all team members, and goes above the minimum allowance required for any employees in countries with leave minimums.

In the bank system, team members accumulate additional days for each month worked at balena, up to both a soft and hard cap. Above the soft cap, there is the choice to be paid out or continue accumulating until they reach the hard cap, where they must be paid out at a percentage of their daily salary equivalent. That way, team members are not forced to take leave for fear of losing it; if they don’t want to take any more leave, they can be paid out instead. We pay at a discount, however, to incentivize people to use their leave first, and only take the payout if they believe that receiving an extra day’s pay at 70% is more valuable than the time off.

“Bonus” days allocated to certain team members for things like night and weekend support shifts and on-call rotations are included within each team member’s leave bank to avoid the confusion of having two different “leave banks,” and to give the team flexibility to be paid out for this type of leave if they prefer, as they would with any other leave accumulated above their bank balance cap.

It’s essential that all leave is booked in advance so that the rest of the team knows you are not working on a particular day. The request and approval process is more about creating a record of who’s out on a particular day than requiring approval, and most requests will be auto-approved. As most requests will be auto-approved, it’s important that the team members requesting leave ensure there will be enough coverage on the team for anything that may need to be done while they are gone. If a team member is scheduled for support during the period they wish to take as leave, they must communicate this and ensure that it is covered before submitting their request. The notice periods above for communicating with other members of the team will ensure appropriate coverage for these tasks or responsibilities. The strategy team may need to look at individual requests that are over 10 business days before approving, to make sure we have appropriate coverage during your absence.

The 12 weeks of parental leave are added to the main leave bank for simplicity and flexibility; to let the team take this time off when it suits them and their family best without any expiry dates or pressure to take it at a certain time, or to choose to be paid out instead of taking additional leave, to support the team member’s growing family.

Employees in Italy & Greece should start each calendar year with 12 days in their bank to allow them to request their local and national holidays. In the rare case that an employee in Italy or Greece is entitled by law to more leave than they are granted under this policy, they will have their accumulation rate increased from 2.5 days per month to represent this, so there is no need to add manual adjustments.

We understand that team members may need to take a period of unpaid leave outside their paid leave allocation for various personal circumstances such as studying, travelling, looking after family etc. We want to be able to accommodate each individual team member as much as we can, and so will discuss this with each team member on a case by case basis to understand their needs, length of time they will need to be away, how we will cover this etc.

As part time contractors work variable hours each month and aren’t fully dedicated to balena in their activity, they are not entitled to paid leave, but can book unpaid leave in order to communicate their absence with the rest of the team.

If you leave the company before your first anniversary (or the anniversary of the new policy on June 1st 2021), the 12 day starting balance will expire and you will not be able to request or be paid out for it. This is to ensure things are fair for team members and the company - if someone left after 1 month, for example, it wouldn’t be fair for them to be paid out for 14.5 days of accumulated leave. Think of it as these 12 days “maturing” after one year in the bank system.



### Appendix A: Greece and Italy leave requirements 
## Greece
Under Greek labour law, vacation days and public holidays are considered separately. The minimum vacation allowance is as follows:
| Years of Employment                     | Number of days |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| First year of employment in a company   | 20 days  |
| Second year of employment in a company  | 21 days  |
| Third year of employment in a company   | 22 days  |
| Ten years of employment in a company or twelve years working history           | 25 days  |
| Twenty-five years working history       | 26 days  |

Employees are also entitled to local and national public holidays, which will vary from year to year. For 2020, this amounts to 10 days which fall within the working week. Any employees who are entitled to more than 20 days vacation + 10 local/public holidays will have their 2.5 days/month accrual adjusted to represent this fact. 

## Italy

Under Italian Labor Law, vacation days and public holidays are considered separately. Employees are entitled to a minimum of 20 days vacation per year. Employees are also entitled to local and national public holidays, which will vary from year to year based on which holidays fall on a weekend. Any public holidays which fall on a Saturday or Sunday will be added to their monthly salary as an extra day’s pay and be visible on their payslip. For 2020, there are 8 public holidays that fall within the working week.
