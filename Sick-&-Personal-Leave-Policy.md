We understand that there will be times when you have to deal with unexpected issues, such as illness, family circumstances or bereavement. We offer all team members flexible working hours, and understand if they need to change their normal working hours or take a few hours off if something comes up. For example, if you need to collect your child from school when they’re sick, you need to attend a medical appointment or deal with a situation urgently, etc. we understand that you may need to take a few hours off, and there’s no need to request a sick/personal leave day. If you’re missing a meeting, or a support shift, it’s important to let the relevant members of the team know you’ll be AFK (away from keyboard) for a few hours.

If that’s not an option, we have a sick & personal Leave policy in place to help the team out when they need more time away from work due to illness or other personal circumstances. 

This allows you to take time off for these unforeseeable circumstances, and lets you rest and get better if you’re sick, or look after and spend time with family when dealing with a difficult situation. 

We don’t currently have a cap on sick and personal leave days; we trust the team to use them when they are needed. 

When requesting sick & personal leave [on Calamari](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Calamari), we request that you leave a comment regarding your absence. This is to let us know what’s going on, how long you might be off and if there’s anything we can do to help. You can also, however, simply write “sick” or leave blank if you’d prefer not to share. 

If you’re going through a difficult time, are concerned about your ability to work for health reasons, or if you are going to need to be off work for an extended period of time (more than two weeks), you can reach out to a member of teamOS to discuss how best we can accommodate your situation.
