We currently have 4 offices which you can see below. These are mainly used by the balenistas based in those cities and others that visit to work there with teammates. Each office has an office manager to oversee operations and the Athens office is managed by the Ops team. You can see the office occupants at the Team Model spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=940422639). 

As all offices remained closed with very limited access due to covid-19, below are some guidelines for the re-opening of all the offices with some key dates and directions to ensure safety.
