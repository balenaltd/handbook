First things first! Before you get access to any of the services we’re using and in order for the team to get you started, you need to have your e-mail account and calendar set up.
* Log into your personal e-mail account (the one you’ve shared with us)
* Open the “Welcome to Resin.io” e-mail
* Follow instructions and set up your e-mail account
* Go to calendar.google.com to see your schedule for today. All your onboarding meetings are already there.

Your inbox will be full of e-mails that our team has already sent you. These are invitations to tools we use, guides and other material that will help you get started.
