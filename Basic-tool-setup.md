### Basic tools<br>
As mentioned at the start, once you log into your @balena.io e-mail account, you’ll find lots of invitations to join our team in several services, online. These are tools the whole team is using on a daily basis and that will make your everyday balena life easier.

**NOTE:** Important! You **MUST** use the same handle across Flowdock, Front, balena forums and GitHub. This is because integrations between services rely on matching handles. It will also make your life easier
when it comes to auto-completing @-mentions.

For now, make sure you have access to the following services:

Primary:
* [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/app)
* [Calamari](https://calamari.io)
* [Front](https://frontapp.com/)
* [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
* [Github](https://github.com)* (**note that you need to set up 2FA when you first login using the Yubikey you have been sent**)
* [Jellyfish](https://jel.ly.fish/)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/)

Depending on your role and team you may have access to additional tech-related, biz-related or team-related tools. Also, if you are employed as a contractor you will have access to [Deel](https://www.letsdeel.com/) for invoicing etc, while others employed as employees will have access to [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/) for examples. You will receive invites to any necessary services on Day 1 and then others will follow as they are needed. 

As needed for doing support when it is time for your support onboarding (request access from the Ops team):
* Zendesk
* [Balena Forums Moderator Access](https://forums.balena.io/)
* Logentries
* [Intercom](https://app.intercom.com/admins/sign_in)
* Support agent access for you balena account (using your balena.io email)

Please note that you should have access to the above services before you start doing support. This is also noted during support onboarding so you can check that you have access to all the services you will need. If you need access sooner, please let the Operations team know and request access.

**Last but very important note! Please bear in mind that to request and obtain access to any service you need to get in touch with the operations team in the operations flow `t/operations` using @@operations and **#access** .**

_* this service requires additional information/steps before you get access to it._


### How to access services that require additional information/steps.
Github

1. Share your username with the Operations team
1. Accept the invitations you'll receive to the inbox connected to your Github account, to join the relevant Github organizations.

_Note: This account should NOT be for daily use, but only for your support role._

### Short introduction to the services/tools we use
**Flowdock** is the chat service we’re using for internal communication. Flowdock is organized in flows that are related to specific balena components and teams. This is the best place to communicate with other team members and ask any questions you have. Here's a [guide](https://github.com/balena-io/balena/wiki/Flowdock) we have put together and [here](https://www.flowdock.com/help) is some more guidance to help you navigate in the flowdock world :)

**Calamari** is the leave management service we use. You’ll be using Calamari to submit your time-off requests and check who’s away.  Here's a short [Calamari getting started guide](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Calamari) for your convenience.

**Intercom** is the customer support chat service we provide to users/guests/clients from the Intercom widget found in the lower right corner of our webapp (on the marketing page and on the balena dashboard.) All Intercom messages are piped into Front, which is where we manage them. We only access Intercom directly when the Front integration isn't working properly.

**Zendesk** is the customer support helpdesk we provide to paid customers. All Zendesk messages are piped into Front, which is where we manage them. We only access Zendesk directly when the Front integration isn't working properly.

**Front** is the service we use to gather all team messages and emails and unite them in one platform. We respond to emails and messages from this platform. It’s integrated with other services, such as Flowdock, Intercom, and Zendesk. Please note that all the Front inboxes you see are not personal -unless you decide to connect your personal inbox to Front- so please do not archive or delete any emails or messages you see, unless you're 100% sure about the process we follow for archiving messages and you know what you're doing. In addition, Front doesn't allow usernames with hyphens so if your GitHub handle has one (or more) then use the underscore instead. 

**Zoom** is the main service we’re using for the company calls. From time to time, we may use also Hangouts, Skype or Mumble. You can use your personal zoom room for quick and emergency meeting calls. Bear in mind that your personal zoom room has a 40 minutes limit. To find your zoom room identity just log onto your account and under "My Profile" tab you can locate your personal zoom room meeting ID. In addition, you can locate your zoom ID by simply asking Hubot when using the ‘get my zoom’ command! 
*Please note that we also use google meets a lot for smaller groups and one to one calls. You do not have to set up anything for this. When you create a calendar invite and add a participant, a google meet room/link will be automatically available for that invite. You can also ask Hubot `get a meet` to get a link that you can jump on right away to have ad-hoc calls. This is the preferred option for such calls. 

**Github*** hosts all our public repos as well as the majority of our private repos. It’s also part of the developer's workflow since this is the place where all issues and tasks are hosted. 2FA auth required!

The **forums** are used by our free users for support requests, and generally for discussion about the product, hack Friday projects, etc. It's required that you have an account there because eventually, you'll need it for supporting users. Please don't forget to use the same handle you've used for other basic services (e.g. flowdock, front etc.)

**Jellyfish** is a social knowledge database and the nerve center of productOS, a platform we are building for developing and maintaining products. It is under active development and is already being used to provide customer support for balena users. Once your Jellyfish account is set up, you will be prompted to change your password.  

**Trello** is a tool we use to track progress for some of our projects. Some teams use it more than others at the moment. It allows more visibility of what everyone id working on within a team. It has boards, lists, and cards to enable you to organize and prioritize projects, tasks, goals and progress.

**NOTE**: To avoid any confusion, you might see `resin` and `resin.io` when reading older information. Balena used to be called resin.io and you can read more about the name change [here](https://www.balena.io/blog/resin-io-changes-name-to-balena-releases-open-source-edition/).
