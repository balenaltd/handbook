First things first! Before you get access to any of the services we’re using and in order for the team to get you started, you need to have your e-mail account and calendar set up.
* Log into your personal e-mail account (the one you’ve shared with us)
* Open the “Welcome to Resin.io” e-mail
* Follow instructions and set up your e-mail account
* Go to calendar.google.com to see your schedule for today. All your onboarding meetings are already there.

Your inbox will be full of e-mails that our team has already sent you. These are invitations to tools we use, guides and other material that will help you get started.

###Basic tools
As mentioned above, once you log into your @resin.io e-mail account, you’ll find lots of invitations to join our team in several services, online. These are tools the whole team is using on a daily basis and that will make your everyday resin.io life easier. Depending on your job position and team you may have access to additional tech-related, biz-related or team-related tools. For now, make sure you have access to the following services:

Primary:
* [Flowdock](www.flowdock.com)
* [Calamari](www.calamari.io)
* [Beegit](www.beegit.com)
* [Front](www.frontapp.com)
* [Zoom](www.zoom.us)
* [Github](www.github.com)*
* Resin.io admin*
* [Timezone.io](www.timezone.io)*

Secondary:
* Intercom
* Zendesk

There’s a distinction between primary and secondary services. You should have access to services of both categories but use the primary services on a daily basis. The secondary services will be used only in case of an “emergency”.

**Last but very important note! Please bear in mind that to request and obtain access to any service you need to get in touch with the operations team in the operations flow (r/operations).**

_* this service requires additional information/steps before you get access to it._

###Short introduction to the services/tools we use
Flowdock is the chat service we’re using for internal communication. Flowdock is organized in flows that are related to specific resin.io components and teams. This is the best place to communicate with other team members and ask any questions you have.

Calamari is the leave management service we’re using. You’ll be using Calamari to submit a time-off request, check who’s away and find coworkers’ information if needed. The company will be using the information you have in your Calamari profile in case it needs to mail you a package.

Intercom is the customer support chat service we provide to users/guests/clients from the Intercom widget found in the lower right corner of our webapp (on the marketing page and on the resin.io dashboard.) All Intercom messages are piped into Front, which is where we manage them. We only access Intercom directly when the Front integration isn't working properly.

Zendesk is the customer support helpdesk we provide to paid customers. All Zendesk messages are piped into Front, which is where we manage them. We only access Zendesk directly when the Front integration isn't working properly.

Beegit is the service we’re using to produce our blog’s content and pipeline, and collaborate with other teammates on this. 

Front is the service we use to gather all messages and emails and unite them in one platform. We respond to emails and messages from this platform. It’s connected with Gmail, Flowdock, Intercom and Zendesk.

Zoom is the main service we’re using for the company calls. From time to time, we may use also Hangouts, Skype or Mumble.

Github* hosts all our public repos as well as the majority of our private repos. It’s also part of the developer's workflow since this is the place where all issues and tasks are hosted.

Resin.io admin means the resin.io administrator dashboard. By having access to the admin dashboard, you have access to user’s devices, stats and additional information. It’s really useful when you provide customer support.

Timezone.io is a one-page website that shows each of the team’s member timezone.

###Photos
We're putting a lot of effort into simplifying and maintaining the remote working culture, making it as easy and friendly for team members to work in it.

Thus, we'd like to ask you to upload a photo to the everyday services you'll be using, such as your @resin.io e-mail and Flowdock. You can use the same photo you use for your social media profiles as long as it is an actual photo of you, as normal as possible! Please send your photo to the Operations team, at operations@resin.io or 1-to-1 in Flowdock, to be used in the [team page](www.resin.io/team).
