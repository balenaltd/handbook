If you're a Windows user and you will be working on any of balena's repos, you will often have to run the app you're working on locally. Balena apps must be run through a Linux terminal (one reason for this is that you cannot set env variables inline in Windows like you can in Linux), so follow this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to install WSL 2 and a Linux terminal on your device.

## nvm
Now that you have a WSL 2 and a Linux terminal installed, you need to install node. Because installing node via apt (`sudo apt install nodejs`) usually installs an older version, you should install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). `nvm` allows you to easily switch between different versions of node. Here are the steps for installing it (run the following commands in your Linux (WSL) terminal):
1. `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash`
2. `nvm install 14`
3. `nvm alias default 14`

*Note: When you switch node versions, run `rm -rf node_modules/` or `npm ci` before running `npm i` again in any repo to ensure that the node modules you have match your node version.*

## Cloning a repo
When you open your WSL terminal, by default you will find yourself in a directory along these lines: `mnt/c/Users/your_user_here`. Cloning your repo in anywhere in this directory and running it will result in Watchpack errors (`permission denied`). To avoid these errors, clone your repo anywhere in your `home` directory instead. To get there, run `cd ~`. Once there, you might want to create a folder to clone your repos in (`mkdir repos`). Once you are inside the folder in your `home` directory in which you would like to keep your repos, you can clone your repos into it. When you first try to clone a balena repo, you will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. Enter your username as you would normally. For your password, entering your GitHub password will result in an `Authentication Failed` error. This is because you have 2FA set up. Instead of entering your password, you must enter your personal access token; follow this [guide](https://webkul.com/blog/github-push-with-two-factor-authentication/) to create one. *You will be able to see it once and never again, so if you want you can save it somewhere safe, **but do not share this token with anyone**.* Alternatively, you could [generate a new ssh key and add it to your GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

## netsh
Now that you have your repository cloned, you could run it via your WSL terminal with one of its `run` commands. Let's use [balena-ui](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-ui) as an example repository. If you run the app, it will compile successfully. You should be able to access it at `https://localhost:3000` (note the `https`), but you will find that you cannot. This is because it is being hosted on your WSL terminal's IP, not on your `IPv4` as when you run the app via your `powershell` or `bash` terminals. To solve this, you need to run the following one-line command in a Powershell terminal with Admin privileges: `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3000 connectaddress=$($(wsl hostname -I).Trim());` (note that `3000` is the port used in `balena-ui` and may differ per repo, so replace `3000` with the port used by the repo you are in). Then, in 2 *separate* WSL terminals, run these two commands (note that these examples are based off the `balena-ui` repo and should be adjusted per repo's run commands. The important part to focus on here is that the app is being served using `ngrok` over plain `http` on the specified port):
1. `npm run serve-dev-http:staging|prod` (choose only staging or prod depending on which API you want to use)
2. `npm run ngrok-http 3000`

Finally, you can access your locally hosted dev server by going to one of the `forwarded` links in ngrok.
*Note: the Powershell command must be run every time you close and reopen your WSL terminal completely because if your WSL terminal has been closed completely and then reopened, it will have a different IP than during the prior session*
