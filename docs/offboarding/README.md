# Offboarding

Offboarding is the last stage of a balenista's journey and whatever the reasons for leaving balena are, we want to make sure offboarding is a positive and smooth experience for everyone. 

## Offboarding kick-off
We are always sad to hear that a balenista has decided to move on but as with everything, we aim for a positive experience during offboarding. After talking to a mission team member (the person guiding your work) you will need to put your decision in writing and to email it to them and cc peopleops@balena.io. After we respond to acknowledge that we have received your email, you will receive an email outlining the next steps for your offboarding. We will use your personal email address for all offboarding communication to make sure you have access to everything discussed beyond your last day too if needed. 
_Things to consider:_ You can find your notice period in your employment contract/ contractor agreement and your leave balance on Calamari. 

## Handover
We want to make sure that responsibilities and tasks will not fall through the cracks, and any work that will need to be paused is not lost. Once you know your last working day, you should start working on wrapping up your work/projects and documenting any work to be ready to be handed over if applicable. You will probably discuss whether colleagues will take over your work and responsibilities with a member of the mission team or the person you are normally getting guidance from. We don't have any strict guidelines for the handover format, so whatever makes sense to you to capture all your work would be fine as long as it includes all relevant links, resources and information. You can also use [this basic template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pkl7JCyzV3owy76rLV8pvGSYzjD4J8y1J9P3iXGqgd0/edit?usp=sharing) and adapt it to your needs. 

## Feedback chat
We are always keen on getting your feedback. As you prepare to leave balena, we would love to hear about what went well, what didn't, and what could have gone better for you. What you have learned, what you are taking away from balena and any suggestions for the things you didn't enjoy as much would also be helpful. We will reach out to check if you are happy to have a chat and schedule a call if so.
