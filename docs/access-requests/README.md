# Access Requests

On your first day, you'll be getting access to a list of services, what we call [the basic tools](../onboarding/basic-tool-setup.md). These services should be all you need to start working and discovering more about balena. However, as the days go by and you dig deeper into your role and into the relevant workflows, you'll discover more services that you may need access to. 

Whenever you need access to a service or anything else that's access-related, you should be using #access in Jellyfish to request it. 
Every time you request access to a service, your message should include 3 basic points:
- #access
- service information (ie service name, org, team) - be as specific as possible but don't worry if you don't have all the information, we'll figure it out together
- access reason - why is access to this service required?

e.g. Can I please get #access to the [Calamari](../tooling/calamari.md)? I want to request some time off.

# Service-specific information
## Jenkins
Jenkins access is assigned to you via the Google admin panel. After you've been given access to Jenkins, please log out of Google and then access [https://jenkins.product-os.io](https://jenkins.product-os.io) to make sure that SAML is authenticated properly.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS access (IAM role) is assigned to you via the Google admin panel. There are three organizations in AWS, where you could be getting access.
