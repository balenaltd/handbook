# Help the team get to know you
Being a remote-first team, we value everything that can help us stay connected and have more face-to-face interaction, so we are putting a lot of effort into simplifying and maintaining the remote working culture, making it as easy and friendly for balenistas. 

Therefore, we'd like to ask you to upload a photo to the everyday services you will be using, such as your @balena.io e-mail and Jellyfish. We also encourage everyone to have their cameras on for the all-hands calls and any other smaller meetings you will be interacting with balenistas, so we can all put a face on those usernames. 

If you want to get an overview of all the folks at Balena, there is a [wall with virtual team magnets](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1wMHCHH6tQhbG1leM_06NtfoMGUMuvgthCddxH01xqD8) or you can see the first iteration of the [team directory](https://balenaltd.io/team)!

While we encourage to keep all written communication in public, we want you to take every opportunity to jump on informal calls with your teammates. Many of us have found useful to do a few one to one calls with different people working on different areas to get a broad understanding of how everything works, as well as connect and start building relationships. You will soon discover that everyone is very approachable and willing to spend some time to go through their work and get to know you, so it should be easy to get to know people.
