# Onboarding

**Welcome to balena [ba·lé·na], you are officially a balenista!**

We are all excited to have you here and we look forward to working with you and getting to know you. You have already met a few other balenistas during the hiring process and you have your gear set up and ready for your Day 1 at balena! In addition to the hardware set up you have chosen for your home/office set up, you will receive a headset, a yubikey, and a balenaFin. We aim to send you these as closest as possible to your start date. We want you to start using balena as a user, spend some time to see what our users experience and provide your valuable feedback around the experience and documentation.

This wiki will provide you with some key information and an overview of how we work. Take your time reading through to familiarize with all the applications and services you will be using soon, before jumping on them. This wiki will not cover everything, so you are encouraged to start interacting with the team to ask questions, get to know everyone and learn more about the exciting projects they are working on!

While we have been investing some time and resources to keep this handbook up to date, things change fast at balena, so we would appreciate your feedback, ideas and observations to help us make it more welcoming and useful for everyone. Tell us what we have missed and what would help more! Feel free to post your feedback about your onboarding experience and the handbook in Jellyfish (you will receive an invite to join on your Day 1) using the hashtag `#teamfeedback`. We expect you to have many questions, so take your time to ask them. Your will meet your buddy and they can guide you where the best place to ask questions.

Before you dive into your onboarding and your balenaLabs residency which will keep you busy for a while, you can start by reading about [The Methods and Motivations of Balena’s Organizational Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bNM-ynzgPa6yyP3HDir131P-Tgp-DxsJaz0CpLqyds/edit#). Enjoy and ask questions :)

## balenaLabs Residency

As a new joiner, you will begin your balena life by joining the balena labs team for a residency (meaning a project/experiment of your own, details [here](../onboarding/balena-labs-residency.md)). balenaLabs (Labs) is an autonomous, public-facing, research and experimentation team within balena. During your residency, which is normally a month, you will be tasked with creating a project and developing it through a full lifecycle, from ideation to publicising it on our balena blog. The labs team will help you every step of the way, and you will gain a [project guide](../balenalabs/project-guide.md) who will help you through it.

This process will help you live the balena user experience, get to know how we work, meet people and find problems you are keen to work on once your residency comes to an end.

More details about labs can be found [here](../balenalabs/README.md)

## New Starter Checklist

You will be busy with reading and onboarding for the next few days, so we have put together a checklist to help you tick off some of the key tasks you will be working on during your first few days and weeks and as you go through this wiki. **Find the new starter checklist [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cQZz8in9iEhsM2_LNaI36tvX_TH1c7RgC-uem78aMV8/edit?ts=5fb3d7b8#gid=0)** and create a copy to keep for yourself.
