# balena Labs residency
Some balenistas live in the [Labs](https://github.com/balenaltd/handbook/blob/main/docs/balenalabs/README.md). They make and maintain projects, help communicate the potential of balena, get feedback, and advocate to improve the product. But that doesn't mean that other balenistas cannot spend time in the Labs and also do those good things.

At various times people will have a one month residency in the Labs to work on a project, typically when they first join balena.

## New Joiners
When you applied for a job at balena, you probably applied for a certain role, such as a frontend developer or an embedded Linux engineer. However, what we really wanted was for good people to apply to work at balena, and *then* find the hard problem they are passionate about solving.

Our mission at balena is to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT device fleet owners. We can only do that if we seek out those sources of friction by living as an IoT device fleet owner or edge developer. It doesn't matter what area of the mission you are contributing to: operational or technical, there is friction to be found and removed.

So, what better way to find that friction than to *become* our user, make an IOT project and live the experience? 

**Your first mission in balena is to make a project and take it through its full lifecycle:**
* explore project ideas and select one
* build the project
* put the project into the public domain
* get feedback and make improvements
* promote your project by writing a blog post on the [balena blog](https://www.balena.io/blog/)

## Choosing a project
Ideally, your project is going to be something you are really passionate about. If you love all things security-related, then maybe build a firewall or a pen(etration) tester kit. Here are some handy [guidelines](https://github.com/balenaltd/handbook/blob/main/docs/balenalabs/project-guidelines.md) as to what makes a good balena project. But more than anything, make something you really care about. The more you love your project, the more you're going to want the balena product to help you build and maintain it.

### My project idea is too big to fit into a month ###
After your residency ends, your project continues to be yours to work on alongside your other work if you wish. Hence work with the labs team and your guide to identify just the first milestone (MVP) which you can fit into your residency. For our personal projects, we used to have devoted regular hack Fridays, but now it is you and your team who decide allocation of your time for your projects. For reference, spending 20% of your time on personal projects you want to pursue is a reasonable ballpark.

### "I don't know what to make! Help!"
**We get it:** not everyone comes into balena with a project idea in their back pocket. And some people don't know what they may want to build. Fear not, we have an [idea pool](https://github.com/balenalabs/balenalabs/projects/1) .
Choose something from the ideas pool, and assign yourself to it. Done! :)

### "I've looked at the ideas pool, and I still don't know!"
No worries, the labs team is here to help you. The best thing to do is to post on the balenalabs loop in Jellyfish and let everyone know you're struggling for ideas. This is a great opportunity for us all to get to know you better, find out the things you like to do, and brainstorm project ideas for you.

## Building the project
You will gain a mentor as part of your residency, called a [project guide](https://github.com/balenaltd/handbook/blob/main/docs/balenalabs/project-guide.md). This person is an old hand at project building, and will help guide you. They will help you to understand how we work, the development loop(s) and what makes a good project into a great project. This role of project guide should be fluid, so although you will initially be paired with someone, that won't be set in stone. If your project is in an area where another balenaista has some expertise - that person can slide into the guide role for you.

### Add it to balenaHub
We want the resident projects to add to our catalogue of great things for users to make use of, and try the balena platform with. So the labs team will work with you to polish your project, test it and make sure it works well, and if appropriate get it added to hub. The process to follow is [here](https://hub.balena.io/submit), but reach out to the team if you need more help.

## Publicize and promote your project
To complete your mission, you need to let the whole world know about your project. But you don't have to do this alone, once again your team has your back. Balena has a whole Outreach team of people who love helping others spread the balena word. They will help you get going with a blog post template and some guidance. (We also have a group of proofreaders to look over your drafts and offer feedback.) They'll even design you some cool graphics for your post, and jam on your writing with you to make it read and look amazing.

### Examples of working in the open and talking about your project
* [Post build logs on the balenaForums](https://forums.balena.io/c/show-and-tell/92) to show off your progress, ask questions, and get ideas from our balena community
* Create a full project post ([example here](https://www.balena.io/blog/how-i-built-a-video-game-prototype-with-custom-hardware-and-balena/)) that shows other users how to get started with their own working version of your project

## For ambitious folks
You don't have to just leave it as a blog post, to publicise your awesome project. Other amazing options available include creating a demo video or livestreaming a build. The goal is to take your hard work and inspire other fleet owners or edge developers to try it out and build their own thing.

So, what are you waiting for? Get in touch and get started. :)
