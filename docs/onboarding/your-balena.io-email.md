# Your balena.io email
You should have received your chosen gear prior to your first day and you should be ready and set up at one of our offices or at your own chosen space. Additionally, you will soon receive, if you haven't yet, a kit to get you started and help you live the balena user experience, if you haven't done so already! 

Before you get access to any of the services we are using and in order for the team to get you started, you need to have your balena e-mail account and calendar set up.
* Log into your personal e-mail account (the one you have shared with us)
* Open the “Welcome to balena” e-mail (note that you need to set up 2FA when you first login using the Yubikey you have been sent)
* Follow the instructions and set up your e-mail account
* Go to calendar.google.com to see your schedule and any onboarding meetings that might already be there.

Your inbox will be full of e-mails that the team has already sent you. These are invitations to tools and services we use, guides and other material that will help you get started.
