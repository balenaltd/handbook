# Leave Policy

## Intro 
The balena paid leave policy is designed to give team members control and flexibility over managing their leave. It should be easy to understand, simple for team members to manage, and be flexible to different preferences. 

Leave days are available to the team for holidays, vacation etc. whilst we also have a [parental leave policy](../policies/parental-leave-policy.md) for team members who are expecting a new addition to their family. For days when you are not able to work due to illness or family emergencies, we have the [sick & emergency leave policy](../policies/sick-and-emergency-leave-policy.md).

A guide to booking time off using [Calamari](https://balena.calamari.io/o/sign-in) can be found [here](../tooling/calamari).

## Policy Details
The policy is based on a “bank” system of accumulating and drawing down leave as described below. 

* On their first day at balena the team members will start with a 12 day balance in their leave “bank”. This applies to team members that have an open-ended agreement with balena and excludes those on a limited-time agreement to work at balena. 
* Full-time team members will accumulate 2.5 days, which will be added to their balance on their “anniversary day” of the following month (this equates to 30 additional days per year). For example, if you started on the 14th of May, you will have your 2.5 days added on the 14th of each following month.
* Part-time team members will accumulate leave on a pro-rata basis calculated on the weekly hours worked. For example, if you work 2 days per week, you will accumulate 1 day, which will be added to your balance on your “anniversary day” of the following month.
* The balance never expires and there is no need to “rollover” from year to year.
* Bonus leave will also be included in your leave bank. For example, if you have accumulated 30 days “leave” but have also accumulated 10 days “bonus leave” this will be included in the same bank, and your total balance would be 40 days. 
* Team members can also “overdraw” their bank if circumstances require. For example, if a team member joins but has a long holiday planned within their first few months of being at balena, they can drop into a negative balance in their bank as needed. This creates an “IOU” that can be made up with future leave accumulation. For now, overdraws are limited to -10 days. If any team member leaves the company with a negative balance, this will be deducted from their final salary.
* By default, leave requests will be “auto-approved.” Team members are responsible for communicating their upcoming leave with the rest of the team and making sure they are appropriately covered during their leave. Recommended notice for coverage would be at least a few days before if you cover a call or are a maintainer, 1 week for weekday support and where possible, 2 weeks for devops weekend rotations. For peak leave periods such as Summer and Christmas, as much notice as possible being given will help the team plan for this. Any requests over 10 business days may need to be discussed prior to request to ensure sufficient coverage.
* All leave, regardless of the nature (business day, bank holiday, local public holiday etc.) will be drawn from the bank and “booked” as leave. It is the responsibility of employees in Greece, UK and USA to request and take their local public holidays as leave.
* When a member of the team is expecting a new addition to their family, they will be granted an additional 12 weeks (60 days) to their leave bank to use however suits them best. Full information on the Parental Leave policy can be found [here](../policies/parental-leave-policy).
* Employees in Greece should always start January 1st of the new year with at least a 12 day balance in their bank. If any team members are entitled to more than 2.5 days/month per local legislation, their monthly accumulation rate will be increased to represent this. Minimum entitlements for Greece can be found in **Appendix A**.
* Team members who want to take extended unpaid leave beyond their paid leave allocation should discuss this with a member of the Leadership group. Unpaid leave will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
* When a team member leaves the company, the relevant local legislation will determine any unused leave to be paid and balena will honor anything additional that is not covered by this policy.
* If you have a negative leave balance on your last day, these days will be deducted from your final paycheck.


## Policy Explanation
By starting with a 12 day balance, new team members have a built-in buffer against overdraft, and are able to take any planned holiday without concern. In countries where local regulation dictates that employees take public holidays, such Greece, these 12 days ensure that employees always have enough leave in the bank to take their public holidays. Team members on limited-time agreements will not receive these 12 days. Should they need to ''overdraw'' their bank by -10, they are able to do so and anything beyond this or any other special circumstances can be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

The adoption of the bank system removes the “use it or lose it” approach to managing leave. It provides the team with flexibility to build up and take leave when it suits them. The system provides a generous amount of leave for all team members and goes above the minimum allowance required for any employees in countries with leave minimums.

“Bonus” days allocated to certain team members for things like night and weekend support shifts and on-call rotations are included within each team member’s leave bank to avoid the confusion of having two different “leave banks”. 

It’s essential that all leave is booked in advance so that the rest of the team knows you are not working on a particular day. The request and approval process is more about creating a record of who’s out on a particular day than requiring approval, and requests will be auto-approved. As requests will be auto-approved, it’s important that the team members requesting leave ensure there will be enough coverage on the team for anything that may need to be done while they are gone. If a team member is scheduled for support during the period they wish to take as leave, they must communicate this and ensure that it is covered before submitting their request. The notice periods above for communicating with other members of the team will ensure appropriate coverage for these tasks or responsibilities. For individual requests that are over 10 business days the team member is responsible for discussing and ensuring there is appropriate coverage during their absence.

The 12 weeks of parental leave are added to the main leave bank for simplicity and flexibility; to let the team take this time off when it suits them and their family best without any expiry dates or pressure to take it at a certain time.

Employees in Greece should start each calendar year with 12 days in their bank to allow them to request their local and national holidays. In the rare case that an employee in Greece is entitled by law to more leave than they are granted under this policy, at the start of the year the extra days will be added to their bank for the year to represent this.

We understand that team members may need to take a period of unpaid leave outside their paid leave allocation for various personal circumstances such as studying, travelling, looking after family etc. We want to be able to accommodate each individual team member as much as we can, and so will discuss this with each team member on a case by case basis to understand their needs, length of time they will need to be away, how we will cover this etc.

For part-time team members, the leave will be calculated on a pro-rata basis based on the weekly hours worked.

### Appendix A: Greece leave requirements 
Under Greek labour law, vacation days and public holidays are considered separately. The minimum vacation allowance is as follows:
| Years of Employment                     | Number of days |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| First year of employment in a company   | 20 days  |
| Second year of employment in a company  | 21 days  |
| Third year of employment in a company   | 22 days  |
| Ten years of employment in a company or twelve years working history           | 25 days  |
| Twenty-five years working history       | 26 days  |

Employees in Greece are also entitled to local and national public holidays, which will vary from year to year. For 2020, this amounts to 10 days which fall within the working week. Any employees who are entitled to more than 20 days vacation + 10 local/public holidays will have any extra leave days added to their bank for the respective year to represent this fact.
