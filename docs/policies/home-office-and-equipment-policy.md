# Home Office and Equipment Policy

While working at balena, we want to give you the tools to work as comfortably and productively as possible. We offer all new team members the equivalent of a $3,300 USD budget for hardware and home office equipment. You are able to pick the hardware you’d like to use (see the Purchasing Information section below).

You will receive an e-mail with ordering information. We have company accounts with major, worldwide vendors (Apple, Dell, Amazon etc.) so you can just send us links from those vendors for the products you would like. If you feel that the worldwide vendors would cause unnecessary delays or customs fees, please talk to us about better local options.

:::note

Note that the hardware you purchase on this budget is owned by balena. At termination it will either be returned, may be purchased from balena, or (depending on the current value and age) may be given to the team member.

## 3 Year Laptop/Hardware Refresh

Team member laptops can be refreshed after 3 years of use. Please reach out to TeamOS around your 3 year anniversary if you’d like to use an additional $3,300 USD budget to order hardware.

## Replacing Hardware Before the 3 Year Anniversary

Our offices have an inventory of used laptops. If you ever find that your laptop is not capable of what you need please contact TeamOS first to see if they have something that is.

If you need to replace any of your hardware or need additional hardware to increase your productivity at balena, please reach out to TeamOS.

If your laptop needs to be repaired, please find an estimate of the cost. If it is under 20% of the laptop price, please have it repaired and expense the cost. If the cost is too high (or if the wait time is too long), please reach out to TeamOS for a used laptop. You should also confirm whether the laptop is under warranty.

## Purchasing Information

Your purchase should include a laptop capable of running what you’ll need to do your job (please do not purchase a desktop computer).

If you do not already have high quality noise canceling headphones (like Jabra Evolve 80 or Bose 700) you can use for work, please purchase some within the hardware budget. Having good audio quality is very important in our communications.

Other items you could buy with your hardware budget include: monitor, docking station, keyboard, mouse, laptop stand, power supply & extension.

As we are a distributed company, all team members can also use up to $500 USD of their hardware budget for their home office (desks, computer chairs, etc.).

If you’re not sure what to purchase, take a look at [recommendations from your coworkers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1dkMP_fuDMLNqvVW5nQwsh3f8l-ZX1Y3Wp_LlSE5yc/edit?resourcekey#gid=25100414).

Please send a [hashtag order request](../team/ordering-hashtag-order-process.md) in a Jellyfish thread.

If you aren’t sure if something is included in the budget, let us know!

## What do we do with our old laptop?

If a laptop is older than 3 years (and replaced by new models) and is valued at over $500 USD, it can either be purchased by the team member or returned to balena. If it is currently valued at under $500, it will often be given to the team member.

## Your Recommendations

If you’ve worked here for a while, you probably have a good idea of what works and what does not. We’d love to hear your feedback for both [hardware recommendations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRKWs1-YrTmzHAl6TXw9mPQS5dbq4lbL-en3cXOzsExcdUTw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and [what software you’re using](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNjmrc3no9u3UPbDlcgEHeWMdopbRos03AbM2Wdz4fjhVyWA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to help others.
