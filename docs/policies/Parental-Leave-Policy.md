## Overview


If you’re reading this for the first time as you’ve just found out you’re going to become a parent (either for the first time, or again!), the first thing we want to say is congratulations!

The balena parental leave policy is designed to give parents who are expecting a new addition to their family the support and flexibility to help them adjust to their exciting new situation, and spend time with their child.

During parental leave, you can have peace of mind that you will remain an integral part of the balena team and that we’ll be on hand to help out in any way we can.

As a globally distributed team, we believe that there isn’t a “one size fits all” solution when it comes to welcoming a new child, and are happy to discuss each individual’s circumstances to adapt your parental leave to what supports you best. We don’t work in a traditional 9-5 office environment, and it’s important our policy reflects this. We also encourage you to remember we are flexible with working hours, and  understand that during your first few months of welcoming a new arrival, you might be less responsive at times while you’re working.


## Policy


### Details
* Parental leave is available to all new parents, regardless of gender, and applies to birth, surrogacy, fostering and adoption.

* All team members who are expecting a child will be granted 12 weeks ( 60 days) paid parental leave, which will be added to your leave bank before the due date of your new arrival. You are not obligated to take it in one single block, and can take time before or after the arrival or your child. These days can also be used to reduce working hours to take half days or half weeks before or after the arrival of your child; it’s completely flexible. 

* If 12 weeks isn’t enough time, we’re happy to offer up to another 12 weeks of unpaid leave to provide you with additional time. 

* If your personal situation means that you would prefer to be paid out for all or part of your parental leave instead of taking time off, you can choose to do this in line with the current leave policy, more information can be found [here](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Leave-Policy). 

* While on parental leave, you will continue to accumulate 2.5 days per month in your leave bank, and can of course use this to extend your time off, should you wish to do so.

* Before starting parental leave, you will be asked to choose a “buddy” who you will be able to check in with, give updates to if you are expecting to take more time off, and will help you transition back to work after a significant amount of time off. This buddy doesn’t need to be someone you work closely with; it’s more important that they are someone you are comfortable talking to and keeping updated about your situation.

* You will have the right to return to the same role at balena after returning from parental leave.

* If there is any additional local legislation for employees that is not covered by the balena policy, we will of course honor that. More information on relevant local legislation for balena employees  can be found in **Appendix A** below.

* Any pre or postnatal appointments should be accommodated by balena's flexible schedule, but you can also take a sick/personal leave day if it will take up half a day or more.

* Team members are responsible for communicating their parental leave with the rest of the team and making sure they arrange adequate coverage while they are off.

### Applying for parental leave

When you find out you are expecting, you should communicate this with a member of teamOS as soon as possible so it can be added to the parental leave tracker, which allows us to track and plan for team members’ periods of extended leave. Then, you should reach out to teamOS again when you know how much time off you are planning to take off, to organize a call to discuss your individual situation. 


The call will discuss any local legislations which may apply, take a note of when you plan to take some time off, when and how you will communicate this to the team and any specific coverage you might need, especially if you are going to be away for more than a couple of weeks. TeamOS will be your point of contact before you take any leave and can answer any questions or doubts you may have; at this point, any special request you may have will be considered and discussed, too. You will then be allocated 12 weeks (60 days) additional leave to your primary leave bank on Calamari, which will be available to be used immediately. When requesting this on Calamari, the comment "parental leave" should be added.

### Buddies for parental leave
During your parental leave call with teamOS, you will also discuss who might be the right person to act as your 'buddy' for the period before, during, and after your time off. Your buddy can be someone you work closely with, so they can help and support you with any handover, updates and/or anything else you will have to consider and arrange during this period. This added support is meant to be an extra resource to make your time off and transition  back to work as smooth as possible for you and your teammates. The buddy support can be as structured or flexible as you like to suit your needs and your preferences.
