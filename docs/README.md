# Welcome 

The handbook is a collaboration of the whole balena team. It is our single source of truth for all things balena.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to make changes to the handbook and to take ownership of sections and pages relevant to them. This is in order to help keep it up to date and useful.

## House Keeping
- Keep all file names in the balenaltd/handbook repo lower case with dashes separating words (with the exception of the README.md). Please don't use any other symbols as naming conventions.

- When making changes, please leave clear and detailed commit messages and descriptions so it's easy to understand what that change was and why that change was made.

**Desired commit message format**
