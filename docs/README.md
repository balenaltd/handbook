# Welcome 

The handbook is a collaboration of the whole balena team. It is our single source of truth for all things balena.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to make changes to the handbook and to take ownership of sections and pages relevant to them. This is in order to help keep it up to date and useful.

For how to edit the handbook, see the [README.md](https://github.com/balenaltd/handbook) within the balenaltd/handbook repo.
