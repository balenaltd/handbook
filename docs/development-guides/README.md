# Development Guide

Most of our development policies revolve around how to commit code and PR it. Here you can find the current [commit and pr guide](commit-and-pr-guidelines). **WARNING:** Although generally correct, some of this is currently out of date and needs updating to the latest version of VersionBot guidelines. If in doubt, ask!

We have several coding standards for different languages, some more fully fledged than others:

* [TypeScript(TS)](typescript-coding-guide)
<!-- * [CoffeeScript(CS)](https://github.com/balena-io/process/blob/master/process/coffeescript-coding-standards.md) -->
* [React](react-coding-guide)
* [Python](python-coding-guide)

There's a guide to [starting a new project](starting-a-new-project) and a good guide to project maintenance [here](maintaining-a-project).

A (mostly) correct guide to deployments is [here](starting-a-new-project).

Finally, you'll probably need to use the Devenv if you're working on core components. The documentation for that is stored [here](https://github.com/balena-io/process/tree/master/process/devenv), with the two most useful being the [getting started guide](https://github.com/balena-io/process/blob/master/process/devenv/setting-up-the-development-environment.md) and the guide on how to add [devices](https://github.com/balena-io/process/blob/master/process/devenv/devices.md).

<!-- ## Support Guide

Support of the service is taken on by all engineers in a rotation that ensures everyone fairly gets assigned. See [here](https://github.com/balena-io/process/tree/master/process/support) for the full set of Support pages. -->
