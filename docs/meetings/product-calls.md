# Product Calls
## Description
Product calls take place twice a week and are led by the product team. It is the time and (virtual) place where we discuss user experience (UX) and feature ideas / questions and come up with implementation plans. Everyone from balena is welcome to join.

## Using the #balena-io-product Flowdock tag
If you have a UX or feature question please tag the thread by adding a comment using **#balena-io-product** and a small summary and, preferably, suggested solution(s). Hubot picks these tagged comments up and sends them to the Brainstorm Topics section in Jellyfish, which largely forms our next meeting agenda.

Product-related discussions live in the 'r/product' Flowdock flow.

## Topic ownership & notes

All reporters are expected to be custodians of their own brainstorm topics; keeping them up to date with notes from the call, any actions, issues or features resulting from the discussion and closing the topics once complete. Any topics left on the `open` status will be put on the agenda for the next call. All product call notes are kept within the timeline of the brainstorm topic on Jellyfish.

## Recordings
The recording of the call will be linked and available at the calendar invite after the end of each call and you can check the previous calendar invites to access the previous recordings. We keep the recordings as convenience to people who might not be able to attend a specific product call and want finer details that cannot possibly be captured with the overview notes. The calls are brainstorming sessions and the recordings should be treated as such.
