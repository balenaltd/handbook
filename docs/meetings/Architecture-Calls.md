# Architecture Calls

## Description

Architecture calls take place several times a week (usually 2 or 3) and are [brainstorming sessions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHb-D2vJxufa8OZPU55V5WBIXuQ44MNL4fcXw52lEe8/view). It is the time and (virtual) place where we generally try to come up with an action plan to tackle non-trivial technical issues across the balenaCloud platform. This call is usually technically oriented and the subjects range from balena backend, devices, cli tools etc. Everyone in the balena team is welcome to join.

There are Architecture Calls per product loop, so e.g. `balena.io architecture` which is broken down to 'software' and 'Harware & Distribution' calls. 

### Process overview

-The agenda will be posted on the r/architecture flow on Flowdock outlining the topics with the respective JF links, reporters and any other useful information. 
-Reporters and those who have been tagged as required will be pinged to be notified
-After the call, the reporter will need to add a #summary comment to the JF topic that summarizes the outcome/next steps and close the topic. There might be cases where the topic should be marked as ongoing. 
-If you cannot make it to the call, please delegate it to someone who will attend and summarize the discussion.

### Using architecture hashtags

In order to raise a topic, you can use the relevant hashtag on FD providing a summary and any relevant documentation. Eg. #balena-io-arch, you can ask Hubot 'show me your hashtags' for some help. Alternatively, you can create a topic directly on Jellyfish. 

### Architecture call recordings

The recording of the call will be linked and available at the calendar invite soon after the call ends. You can check the previous calendar invites to access the previous call recordings. We keep the recordings as convenience to people who might not be able to attend a specific architecture call and want finer details that cannot possibly be captured with the overview notes. The calls are brainstorming sessions and the recordings should be treated as such.
