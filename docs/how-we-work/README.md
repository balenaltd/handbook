# How we work: Jellyfish

Balena uses [Jellyfish](https://jel.ly.fish) as our platform for documenting discussions, meetings, topics, and improvements. This is an [open source project](https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish) available for anyone to use!

This platform is incredibly powerful for connecting context and is being improved everyday. 

The core concept to understand when using Jellyfish, is that everything revolves around a Loop.

### Loops

At balena, we structure our team as a collection of feedback loops. What we often call "the loop" is our framework for continuously improving products. We also define specific loops at balena that focus on building products for a particular user. Each of these loops puts "the loop" framework into practice to build a product for its users. For example, the teamOS loop uses "the loop" to build and improve the user experience for balena team members. The balena.io product loop uses "the loop" to build and improve the user experience for balena users. And so on.

The main, and most up to date introduction to loops is this video from Summit 2020 - [Welcome to the loop factory!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TM_CGoYav9JGRCf72JEDH5U4-h_jaWje/view?usp=sharing) (starts at 9m15s)

The best reference for how we define various loops is [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LLxXv9tJYdReIN81oZMKjMxBzsVDFVSR).

### How to use the Loop

Jellyfish offers several tools to use within the Loop. Please see them in the [Resource Glossary](./resource-glossary/).
