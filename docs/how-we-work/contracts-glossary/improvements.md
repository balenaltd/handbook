# Improvements

Improvements are a way to document the entire thought process regarding the who, what, where, and why. In your Improvement description use the sample text as a guide to provide as much context so that even someone else is able to pick up the work and implement. 

Improvements can be created without a topic but ideally were inspired by a discussion the team had. Improvements will begin as Proposed and move to Researching (Drafting Spec) when the relevant working group agrees it's worth doing. 

Once the description has been made you can still make edits later on but ideally, changes on an Improvement are tracked in the timeline via [Threads](./threads.md).

Improvements will contain [Milestones](./milestones.md) to track actionable items. These are helpful when the Improvement is a large change and allows you to work towards your goal in more reasonable chunks.
