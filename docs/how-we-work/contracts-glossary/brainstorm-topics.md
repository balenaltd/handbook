# Brainstorm Topics

Topics should include the problem they are trying to solve or opportunity we want to explore.

They must not include a suggested solution. This is to ensure conversations about the problem are not biased. 

GOOD: "How to cache requests in the API"
BAD: "Discuss using redis to cache API requests"

You can create a topic and add it to the appropriate category so during the next call it gets reviewed. For example, create a topic and adding it to `balena-io security` ensures the security loop looks at the topic. However, ensure that when you create a topic, try not make one that already exists! If a topic matches your new ideas/concerns you may move it to open.

If a topic does not conclude to an Improvement, this is ok! The topic will contain messages (threads) discussing the outcome from the discussions. These act as logs for decisions made so that they can be referenced later on if the topic is revisited. Otherwise, if a topic requires some changes to be made, you would make an [Improvement](./improvements.md).
