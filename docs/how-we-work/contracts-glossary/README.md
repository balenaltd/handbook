# Contracts Glossary

Jellyfish offers you a set of tools that help you to track ideas or work being done. This means, you are able to add discussion points, create improvements you would like to see, and automatically observe common patterns across the every [Loop](../#loops).

These tools are known as Contracts. They can be created at any time on the platform but only truely become powerful once you begin to connect them.

### Threads 

A thread is a conversation on any Contract. You might find one or more of these on the contracts listed here! For example, if you had a concern about a [Topic](#brainstorm-topics) you can start a thread! If you had a suggestion on an [Improvement](#improvements) you can start a thread! If you see a discussion you can add some info to, just join the thread!

See [Threads](./threads) for more.

### Milestones 

These are bit size steps towards completing an Improvement. You can use these to break up a larger solution into small actionable steps.

See [Milestones](./milestones) for more.

### Improvements

These are used for documenting a change or addition to a system. The goal is to document enough information such as who is the affected users, the current solution, purposed solution, and migration steps, etc. You want your improvement to contain enough context so that anyone is able to pick it up and implement it.

See [Improvements](./improvements) for more.

### Sagas 

A collection of Improvements to track the overall progress of a long term objective.

See [Sagas](./sagas) for more.

### Brainstorm Calls 

These are for capturing all of the discussed [Topics](#brainstorm-topics) in a planned or adhoc meeting.

See [Brainstorm Calls](./brainstorm-calls) for more.

### Brainstorm Topics 

These are ideas or concerns that should be discussed during a call.

See [Brainstorm Topics](./brainstorm-topics) for more.

### Support Tickets 

These are our most important funnel because they are commonly the source of our brainstorm topics, and Improvements. They help us to observe what kind of issues or needs our users have.
