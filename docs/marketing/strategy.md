# Labs Strategy

balena Labs is guided by the [balena Labs Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CyFKoTX9H2MQVYJXL19X4snDcmA8j20Wfr_B7_g8h58/edit?usp=sharing). It covers the purpose and mission of balena Labs, our ways of working, and includes a series of tools for validating Labs activities against broader company objectives. The strategy has been developed collaboratively and like all good strategies is adaptive based on the changing needs of balena.
