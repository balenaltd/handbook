# Project Guidelines

A project is a personal piece of work, which is developed in a balenista's personal loop with help and support from the balena labs community. Any idea can be made into a project, with a few rules:

- It uses balena, or can attempt to break the security of balena, or can be a tool built using balena-sdk or balena-API or other balena components.
- It aligns with the [balena Labs Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CyFKoTX9H2MQVYJXL19X4snDcmA8j20Wfr_B7_g8h58/edit#heading=h.vkqeoxqdhw)
- It is evidenced as having value through [identified signals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CyFKoTX9H2MQVYJXL19X4snDcmA8j20Wfr_B7_g8h58/edit#heading=h.gbyxvc81pipm)
- Any external user should be able to build the same project
