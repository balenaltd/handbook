# How we Work

### First, understand our users

What are the needs of the fleet owners; the edge developers and engineers that are deploying and managing 1000s of devices in real world applications? Put yourself in the shoes of our users, and try to empathize with the problems they are trying to solve on a day to day basis. Take a look at our case studies to see some examples.

### Then, understand the product

Labs is not a traditional marketing or sales team, and we’re not asking anyone to go out and promote something they don’t themselves believe in. If you think a product is awful, tell someone! If there are bugs or blockers, make noise! Do not work around these issues, as our paying customers and external users probably won’t.

### Use all the things

Become the most demanding balena user there is, ask for the most and expect the best. If you don’t get this, make noise about it; create issues, submit feature requests and even create PRs. Feel obligated to keep pushing until the right thing happens. Pioneer the use of the latest and greatest features, ensure they work as expected and solve real problems.

## Encourage, engage and build community

### Encourage and support… everyone!

We should take it upon ourselves to encourage and support anyone who wants to build a project using balena; this could be someone on twitter, to a forum user, a support ticket or members of our own team. Be friendly and approachable-- everyone is a potential balena user… perhaps even a customer!

### Educate

There are loads of people with ideas out there but don’t have the knowledge or confidence to get started. We have a privileged position where we can provide free educational resources enabling people to get started with edge computing and IoT.

### Cultivate community

Participate in discussions even if it isn’t strictly necessary. Someone posted on the forum and didn’t get a reply? Say thanks for sharing, ask questions, engage with them. Start the discussion, inspire others. This works anywhere that we have a voice; social media, forums, YouTube, Reddit, Stack Overflow etc. Don’t forget to collect and report this info back to the team-- this is great foundational material for new projects, expanding existing ones, AMAs, etc.

### Share and take people on a journey

We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by sharing our projects publicly (e.g. forums, social media, live streams). We (for the most part) don’t have to work in private until a project is complete and then make an announcement, we can take the community on the journey with us.

## Take a look around

### Test and try competitors’ offerings

It’s important that we don’t isolate ourselves within the balena ecosystem. We should spend time using and reviewing other products; learning from other offerings (good and bad), and figuring out how they compare. Do they do the same thing, are we missing any useful features from other platforms, what are our competitors doing better than us?

### Are we doing what the market needs

We should constantly check we’re on the right course and make sure what we’re doing is what the fleet owners out there need to solve their problems. If we’re doing what they need, are we the best at it? Are we the most compelling option in the space?

### Integrate, be compatible

Can we integrate with other products, either to enhance ours or enhance theirs? What makes most sense from the user’s point of view? For example a monitoring product may enhance an existing balena-user’s project, and balena products may enhance a user’s experience or make deployment of an existing software product easier.

## Approach

### Make success easy, make failure hard

Projects should ‘work by default’. This means requiring the minimum number of steps and minimum amount of hardware to make a successful deployment. It means setting defaults for environment variables wherever possible rather than asking the user to set one before a project will work. It means getting to a point of success with the least amount of time and effort. Any additional, advanced configuration should be undertaken as a second step (make it work, then make it better, again).

### Inspire to create and share

Create projects that we think people would want to replicate and share, or inspire them to build their own. The more who build and share, the more insight and learnings we can gather.

### Consider the experience

When a user deploys our projects, they are indirectly receiving a demo of our products. Therefore a poor project experience also reflects on the product. Aim for a smooth and fluid experience throughout the guide and deployment, and consider ways we can do better.

### Prefer feature requests over issues

This means to aim to create a good basic core feature-set that works well (see above point), and does not cause people to have to create Github issues. We’d much prefer a basic, working feature set than a complex one that isn’t as smooth. We can always add features later but may not get a second chance at getting the user to deploy fixes if they failed the first time.

### Lower the barrier to entry

Projects should have the lowest barrier to entry possible. We do want to show off the more feature packed boards, high performance hardware etc., but it’s better to do this where the user can make a start, and perhaps achieve an MVP with what they have lying around or can obtain quickly/easily/cheaply. After they’ve achieved success we can suggest hardware to improve it. For example; an AI/ML project that runs on the Pi 3 - it may be really slow, but it works. As a second step the user could try a Jetson Nano, or a Coral USB accelerator etc., and see the performance boost.

### Operate in the open

As a remote team spread across the world it is very important that we keep channels of communication open and available. As much as possible, all communication should be done in a location that is visible to the rest of your team. Actively communicate your ideas and feedback with colleagues and be willing to field any questions your colleagues might have. If in doubt be overly-communicative.
