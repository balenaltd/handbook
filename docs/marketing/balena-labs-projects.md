balenaLabs is the brand associated with example projects and code which have been developed by the marketing team to help users get started with balena. balenaLabs projects rely on the balena team and community contributions for maintenance, to prevent creating a higher maintenance burden for these projects the team now focuses on supporting community members and partner companies to create and maintain their own projects on balenaHub.

**balenaLabs projects should be:**
_comprehensive projects that demonstrate the potential of the Balena platform for fleet management_
High quality and strategic projects. Projects showcase the capabilities of the Balena ecosystem, demonstrate thought leadership, give users a way to test the Balena platform in a non-committal way, and be something we are willing to upkeep as a whole team. These projects are not made with the expectation of community PRs or maintenance, but they are (certainly & very) welcome.
