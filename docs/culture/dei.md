# Diversity Equity and Includsion
## [What Is DEI](https://www.inclusionhub.com/articles/what-is-dei)

Our goal is to have omni-win-win work environment. 

All of us are linked by a shared thread, our DNA. We are all 99.5% genetically alike; our similarities are so much greater than any differences. It is a scientific fact. And yet, many people disproportionately experience injustices and prejudice that can put their lives on completely different trajectories. We are all human, and we all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. 

* We want to be a place where everyone can thrive and be their best selves. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels safe and included. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they belong. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be themselves. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can contribute and make a difference. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can grow and learn. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be heard. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be respected. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be valued. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be supported. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be empowered. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be challenged. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be inspired. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be motivated. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like they can be encouraged. 
* We want to be a place where everyone feels like the work is rewarding.

## Flat Organization

We live in a society with standard corporate structure and hierarchy from larger culture. 
How can Balena succeed with an omni-win-win culture and a flat organization in a realistic way?

## Some basic tools to help us achieve our goal:

* Be empathetic, put yourself in the other person's shoes.
* Speak out when you see sexism or racism happening.
* Make sure equal contributions are welcomed.
* Allow everyone to talk in meetings.
* Question your own assumptions, beliefs, and implicit biases.
* Double check how your language might be perceived.
* Reframe discussions.
* Look out for stereotypes.
* Listen to others.
* Keep an open mind.


# Racism

Here are some articles to read about difficulties people of color may face in engineering:

# Sexism

Here are some articles to read about difficulties women may face in engineering:

## [MIT Study: Why Do Women Leave Engineering](https://news.mit.edu/2016/why-do-women-leave-engineering-0615)

Group dynamics of teamwork and internships deter many women in the profession.

The study finds, women often feel marginalized, especially in self organized team-based activities. In those situations, gender dynamics seem to generate more opportunities for men to work on the most challenging problems, while women tend to be assigned routine tasks or simple managerial duties.

To take an example, one student named Kimberly described an episode in a design class in which "two girls in a group had been working on the robot we were building in that class for hours, and the guys in their group came in and within minutes had sentenced them to doing menial tasks while the guys went and had all the fun in the machine shop. We heard the girls complaining about it." 

Or, as the paper puts it, "Informal interactions with peers and everyday sexism in teams are particularly salient building blocks of gender segregation."

## [An Engineers Guide to Sexism by Teresa Meng](https://www.eetimes.com/an-engineers-guide-to-sexism/)

This is a talk by Teresa Meng at International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) on the institutional sexism in the Engineering profession.

* Women may be considered less trustworthy. When male and female offer different versions of a story, supervisors lean toward believing the man.

* Women's contributions may not be considered as valuable.
"While brainstorming, I share my own idea. Then a male colleague elaborates on it a bit more." The next thing you know, after a few exchanges, Meng's idea became his idea. Of course, if she ever tells people that it was her idea, she's being "petty."

* Women may be considered incapable of standing alone.
Many people harbor the notion that women can't stand alone. Essentially, they don't believe women can succeed on their own, Meng noted.

* Pick your battles
Sexism and discrimination confront women every day. Meng's most important piece of advice to her female colleagues is "pick your battles." Meng said, "We need to think clearly and strategically, after the emotions pass." At stake is a woman's career and profession. 

* Sexual harassment
Subtle or blatantly inappropriate comments or actions in the workplace. 
Usually, bad behavior of this sort is not in isolation. It is often part of a pattern of behavior that affects many people.

* Gender wage gap
Salary disparity is real. Ask your male colleagues what they make.

* What to do:
Meng decided to look for "engineers with strong ability and high integrity who could appreciate others' work." Choose your team wisely.

## [Wikipedia: Factors Contributing to Lower Female Participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_engineering#Factors_contributing_to_lower_female_participation)
 
Women may receive lower pay, more responsibilities, or less appreciation as compared to men. However, women may have more potential to become good leaders: studies have indicated that women have more key leadership skills; for example, the ability to motivate employees, build relationships, and take initiative.

Communication is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. Male-to-male communication is said to be more direct, but when men explain a task to a women, they tend to talk down, or "dumb down" terms. This comes from the stereotype that men are more qualified than women, and can cause men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.


## [Sexism in the Workplace](https://www.uopeople.edu/blog/sexism-in-the-workplace/)

No matter how it shows up, it should be met with zero tolerance.

### Types of sexism: 

* Hostile: This type of sexism shows up as demeaning and makes women seem inferior to men in the workplace. An example of hostile sexism is the use of words with negative connotations to address or describe a woman.

* Benevolent: Benevolent sexism shows up in more unconscious ways. It's the idea that women should be taken care of and men should be the providers. In an occupational setting, this can present as women being left out of work meetings under the assumption that they wouldn't want to go.

### Examples Of Sexism In The Workplace

* Insults As jokes: One of the most common forms of sexism happens in the form of jokes.

* Role Stereotypes: This shows up when there are different tasks at work, and people assign who they think should fulfill the duty based on stereotypical roles. 

* Physical focus: Comments and focus on a woman's appearance can be sexism.

* Gender labeling: Another stereotype that happens is if a woman is assertive, she may be called bossy. If she's not as assertive as expected, then she may be thought of as weak. As with all types of sexism, this often happens subconsciously, so it's important to self-evaluate regularly.

* Devaluing women's opinions: When men talk over women or over-explain things to them (which has become known as mansplaining), it can be a form of sexism. 

### Negative Effects Of Sexism In The Workplace
The effects of sexism within the workplace extend into a woman’s everyday life. They can cause financial issues, negatively impact mental health, hinder a career, and can even place a woman in a dangerous place physically.

The remarks and attitudes towards women in the workplace can cause detrimental mental health side effects for women.

For example, white men are 41 percent more likely to be executives than white women. It goes up to 260 percent more likely than Asian women, 418 percent than Black women, and 438 percent than LatinX women.
