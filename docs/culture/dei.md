## Flat Organization

Balena is a flat organization. 

We have no managers and have self forming teams. 

We have no titles and have no hierarchy.

We are self driven and self organizing. 

We are all responsible for the success of the company, our team, our customers, products, mission, vision, values, culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion.

We live in a society with standard corporate structure and hierarchy from larger culture. 

How can our organization succeed with omni win win culture in a realistic way?

## Some basic tools to help us achieve our goal:

* Be Empathetic, put yourself in the other person's shoes.
* Speak out when you see sexism or racism happening
* Make sure equal contributions are welcomed
* Allow everyone to talk in meetings
* Question your own assumptions and beliefs and implicit biases
* Double check how your language might be perceived
* Reframe discussions
* Look out for stereotypes
* Listen to others
* Keep an open mind
