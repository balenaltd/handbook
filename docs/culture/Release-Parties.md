# Release Parties

## What’s a Release Party?

Our team gets together every once in a while to sprint on releasing a new feature. To make it more interesting and to involve our community, we stream it live during an event we call a Release Party. It’s a testament and spotlight on how well we work together as a fully remote, international team and a way to celebrate with our community.
