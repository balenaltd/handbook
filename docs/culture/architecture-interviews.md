# Architecture Interviews

Alex (our CEO) and other long time balenistas took some time to explain the service & feature landscape of Balena by answering questions from new joiners. These [video recordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KXEtlf9kwiZoxQmHjFOO-c9q_0q9KSMY) can help you get an overview of what we work on.

These interviews are driven by questions from new-joiners, so if you're new and feel some things are missing, why not ask for another interview round yourself?
