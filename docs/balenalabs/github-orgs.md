# GitHub Orgs

Weâ€™ll be working within 4 main organizations:

## [balena-labs-projects](https://github.com/balena-labs-projects)

_comprehensive projects that demonstrate the potential of the Balena platform for fleet management_
High quality and strategic projects. Projects showcase the capabilities of the Balena ecosystem, demonstrate thought leadership, give users a way to test the Balena platform in a non-committal way, and be something we are willing to upkeep as a whole team. These projects are not made with the expectation of community PRs or maintenance, but they are (certainly & very) welcome.

## [balena-labs-research](https://github.com/orgs/balena-labs-research/repositories)

_projects to aid in research and experimentation of new Balena related products_
Research and development related projects. These are projects that are past the quick-hack phase, and theorized as being a tractable solution to customer patterns or a future Balena product. There should be low expectations on stability or regular maintenance. Each project will provide a thoughtful readme as a bar to entry for development and use. The goal should be to start the feedback loop much earlier in the process of potential product design

## [balena-io-experimental](https://github.com/balena-io-experimental)

_anything from initial proof-of-concept to basic promotion but not necessarily maintained and working_
When working on and building a project, and whilst under development, the code should be stored and iterated upon whilst in the playground.
