_Explore and communicate the potential of the balena platform, accelerating its full realization_

## Introduction
balenaLabs (Labs) is an autonomous, public-facing, research and experimentation team within balena. We’re the most demanding users, and yet friendly. We’re balena’s biggest fans, its harshest critics, and have the responsibility of making sure that feedback is heard and actioned.

We go out into the world, demonstrate the potential of balena, gain attention, get feedback, and bring back our learnings to inspire and educate our team. We build cool stuff using devices we have at home and show it off, we make edge computing more accessible for our customers, and we make life easier for our users. We’re bringing people together into a new community to figure out this new industry and make IoT projects successful. We’re exploring and communicating the potential of the balena platform, with the aim of accelerating its full realization. To name a few of ways we interact with the public, 

- we write blog posts: sometimes about product features, but more usually about [projects](https://www.balena.io/blog/show-tell-a-steampunk-desktop-background-radiation-monitor/) and new [balenaBlocks](https://www.balena.io/blog/how-to-make-your-own-balenablocks-simple-drop-in-edge-app-functionality/)
- we hang out in the [project clinic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-4ZuCa8Y-Y) to answer project questions and show off our projects
- we write [build logs](https://forums.balena.io/t/bluetooth-low-energy-ble-locating-using-ml/343865) in the forums and encourage others to do so.

## If you’ve just joined…
Welcome! You may be wondering where to start. First and foremost it’s important you understand the product(s); take some time to try everything balena offers and figure out its purpose. The company mission is to reduce friction for fleet owners, and everything you see should fit that. As a member of the Labs team you’ll be operating in some part as a tame balena customer who wants to make the product better, so you’ll need to be able to put yourself in those shoes.

Make sure you understand what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, this is important; don’t do things blindly or simply because someone said so.

The first thing to do is to join the [/balenalabs](https://www.flowdock.com/app/rulemotion/balenalabs) flow in flowdock and introduce yourself to the team. They will then help you to get started with your life in labs. 

## What are we doing?
As a team, we’re going to be pushing forward on a few fronts which we’ll call layers. Some projects and initiatives will push forward on multiple layers but others may solely fall within a single layer.

### Layer 1: Brainstorm, build, and promote
This is the core of everything we do in the Lab. Create demonstrative projects and content to inspire users and gain attention. Some of our most popular and attractive projects have been things that nobody expected - build prototypes of your ideas and get them out there!


### Layer 2: Create a sustainable community
Cultivate a user community by allowing and encouraging contribution and involvement from the world outside balena. Encourage development of our own and original works.


### Layer 3: Framework for fleet owners
Give IoT & edge computing developers tools and building blocks to make it easier to get their projects off the ground and allow them to focus on their use case. Aim to get them  80% of the way there before they start.


### Layer 4: Ambient computing for humans
Steer the edge computing movement toward helpful technology that seamlessly integrates and enhances the lives of real people, avoiding privacy and surveillance concerns.


### Layer 5: Experimentation in the wild
Deploy our projects into the homes and offices of our team to gather real world usage data and feedback - what works, what doesn’t. We can trust others in the team to provide us with honest feedback to close the loop and improve the project.
