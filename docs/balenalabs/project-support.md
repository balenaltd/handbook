# Project Support

Projects are distinct from product work by the fact they are developed by an individual balenista or small group. They are hacks born out of an interest, a spark of inspiration or a personal passion. They don't require product or architecture calls, they exist purely in your personal loop. Everyone at balena should have a personal project. They are a chance to hack on something concrete and near-term, to get a break from the abstract [#stpltg world of being a product builder](../products-and-productization/being-a-product-builder.md). They should be rooted in something you feel passionate about, and motivated to want to complete/solve. They are you "skin in the game".

Here's a guide to what makes a good project: [Project Guidelines](./project-guidelines.md)

[Some people](https://www.balena.io/blog/show-tell-a-steampunk-desktop-background-radiation-monitor/) find thinking up and building projects all very easy. But, for the rest of us, we need a bit of support. Coming up with ideas is hard. Designing a plausible solution is harder. Building the thing, well that can be even harder, at least to begin with. But the good news is that you don't have to do this all on your own. A project shouldn't be a(nother) source of stress to you. It's a chance to hack, experiment, try, fail, learn - all with no risk.

## Labs

The balenaLabs is the first place to come and find some support. It's home to Hardware Hackers who make projects all the time, [residents](../onboarding/balena-labs-residency.md) and people from across the company hacking on their own personal projects. It's a super friendly place full of people who want to help. Egos are left at the door, since we're all just pretending we know what we're doing, and making it up. Even if you don't know how to power up a Pi - come and say hello, and tell us of any project ideas you have. We want to help you. :)

## Project Guide

Everyone should have a [project guide](./project-guide.md) who can help guide them with their project work. These people have built projects before and can act as a sounding board and mentor with a regular sync meeting. They'll also be great at signposting other places to get support, such as the project clinic.

## Project Clinic

Like all loops at balena, the labs team also had a brainstorm. But unlike the other loops, these weren't acting to decide what should or shouldn't be done. They were more like a clinic, where the labs team supported each other with technical project questions. And since everyone at balena should have a personal project, why not open the meeting up to all? In fact, our users will need project ideas and support too. So why not make the whole thing public, and help everyone?

The project clinic is a weekly session, hosted in streamyard and streamed to balena's YouTube channel. It is open to EVERYONE to join in. The more we all participate the more impactful and helpful it becomes. Here's how you can join in:

### Join the stream

Each week the streamyard link will be sent out in /all. You can join this link before the show, and take part in the stream. We need all sorts of participants:

- Experienced project builders: if you've made a project, written some code, soldered something, 3D printed something - any of those, please come and help answer some questions.
- Project Showcase: come and talk about your project. Maybe give a progress update or show a demo. It doesn't have to be finished, or perfect. Working in the open benefits everyone!
- Project questions: perhaps you have the beginning of an idea and what to know how to start? Or you have a project but you're stuck? Or you can't find a sensor/screen/thing that would work for your project? Come and ask the team!
- Watchers: maybe appearing on the stream is not your thing? Well, you can still join in by watching the youtube stream and sending in comments. You can ask questions, send in answers to other questions, mock the show....anything. Just don't be silent. :)
