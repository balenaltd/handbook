# Project Lists

The Labs project lists outline potential Labs research and Labs projects based on identified ‘signals’; that is, indicators from various sources of their potential value to Balena. Cards are projects or initiatives and should flow from left to right on the board, but may stall or move around depending on delays, blockers or other factors.

## Where are project lists kept?

Lists are maintained on Github Project boards. There are different boards for each Labs activity:

[Balena-Labs-Projects board (aka idea pool)](https://github.com/orgs/balena-labs-projects/projects/3)
[Balena-Labs-Research board](https://github.com/orgs/balena-labs-research/projects/2)

## Who can work on one of the projects?

Anyone and everyone, although check in with the Labs team before embarking on a project from the board to check if there is already progress made and to ensure there isn’t anything higher priority which may also be of interest. Also be sure to check in with the maintainer team to ensure other priorities are not negatively impacted.

If there is a project that requires a range of different expertise, we will help facilitate the creation of a group to work on the project which allows us to all benefit from the comparative advantages of others.

## How to suggest a new project

Simply ping the Labs team on the chat, or come and join the Labs brainstorm call. It doesn’t mean you will have to work on it, we are just as interested in gathering ideas for projects which others can then work on if they have interest.
