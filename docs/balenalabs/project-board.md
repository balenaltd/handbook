# Project board

[Labs project board](https://github.com/balenalabs/balenalabs/projects/1)

The project board should hold a snapshot of everything going on in the lab at any one time. Cards are projects or initiatives and should flow from left to right on the board, but may stall or move around depending on delays, blockers or other factors.

Labels can be used to categorize where we think this project sits, again for balance purposes, we shouldn’t focus all of our efforts in one area at all times.

Cards have a few fields to help us categorize projects and see at a glance what work is going on:

## Device type

This indicates what device a project uses. For example there has been a concern that too many of our projects focus on the Raspberry Pi, so this lets us see at a glance what we have available for what device types. We should aim to support multiple device types with each project when possible.

## Demand

Where did the demand for this project come from? This shows the balance of source of projects we’re working on, in order to avoid concentrating too much in one area. A good spread across all areas is the aim here.

## Tier

This relates to where in the lifecycle a project is currently sitting, and can change as a project is developed. 

## Repo

A link to the Github repo for this project, allowing the team to easily reach it and link the cards with code.
