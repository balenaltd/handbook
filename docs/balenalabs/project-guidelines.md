# Project Guidelines

A project is a personal piece of work, which is developed in a balenista's personal loop with help and support from the balena labs community. Any idea can be made into a project, with a few rules:

- It uses balena, or can attempt to break the security of balena, or can be a tool built using balena-sdk or balena-API or other balena components.
- You can't use special privileges to code the project. Any external user should be able to build the same project

## Idea validation checklist

Referenced in Validation to [Layer 1](./README.md#layer-1-brainstorm-build-and-promote) workflow

- Does running this project on balena help the user (IoT tinkerer/hacker, fleet owner, etc.?
- Are we lowering the bar of entry to a scaled use case?
- Are we using or improving upon any existing blocks?
- Are we creating any new blocks?
- Does completing this project enhance our framework?
- Are we demonstrating a new balena feature?
- Is it an ambient computing project?
- Is it an integration with another company/provider/platform?
- Does it have a chance of viral attention?
- Is it awesome?

## Results & Outcomes

-2 - the fact that this project exists causes confusion and support issues - delete it

-1 - project has little to no users, downloads, or interactions. Archive to make clear that it is no longer maintained or supported in any way, but it's still visible.

0 - project helps users by the fact that it exists to provide a demonstration of a feature or example code, but is not showing any signs of growth. Continue to maintain it as a low priority

1 - project is high ROI, baseline for others to beat, continue to promote whenever possible until better project appears or project conversion rates fade

2 - escape velocity: project generates own community and hype. if ROI drops low enough, cut loose but continue to develop. otherwise continue to invest.

3 - profit potential: project has connected product that shows hints of sustainability, consider developing further to get to sustainable status
possible flow reversal: profitable projects may fund their own promotion, therefore tilting the ROI equation

4 - users show strong interest in new features, if we feel further development can drive the project to high ROI or outcome 0/1/2, return to implementation phase for another run

5 - project is showing signs of explosive growth in all dimensions. Brainstorm out-of-the-box ways to capitalize, including "fold into product", "make own tributary/loop", "spin off into its own startup", or whatever else makes sense in the context of that project.
