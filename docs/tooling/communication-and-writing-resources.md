# Communication and writing resources

### Resources that can help you communicate at balena
As a distributed team, much of our communication happens in written form, with some higher bandwidth discussions over call/video as well. It's extremely important that we all communicate clearly with one another, and work on honing our writing and speaking skills. The team has started a list of resources that might be helpful if you're looking for ways to improve those skills. Contributions are welcome!
