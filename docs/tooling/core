# Password Management

Starting from Day 1, you’ll be required to join a list of services that you’ll be using on a daily basis. Also, depending on your job position and the team that you’ll join, you’ll be given access to additional services. We strongly recommend using a password management service to manage all your passwords and logins. In any case, NEVER keep your passwords in a notebook. NEVER share your, or company’s, passwords with anyone. 

If you don’t know of any password management services to manage all your passwords, take a look and choose from the list below: 

* [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)
* [Keepass](http://keepass.info/)
* [Lastpass](https://lastpass.com/)
* [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)
* [1Password](https://1password.com/)
* [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org)

Balena is using [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to manage passwords centrally and share them with team members when needed. As soon as you need shared log in details to access a service, you will be required to create a Bitwarden account, following instructions in [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_0MZ0BsIepdWTdoj4BMeSUlVG0-v3WNc6HCxP8t6pk/edit?usp=sharing). You can ask for access to a service by using **#access**, and pinging @@operations, in Jellyfish and they will share any passwords you require to access services through Bitwarden.
