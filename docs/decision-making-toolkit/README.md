Everyone should be able to have the autonomy to make decisions at balena, and feel comfortable and confident when doing it. Not just in making a decision, but knowing what steps to take when you need more information and how to get it.

This section of the handbook will aim to provide you with a decision makers toolkit. In it you will find answers to the following:

- [Why is it important for everyone to be a decision maker?](../decision-making-toolkit/why-is-it-important-for-everyone-to-be-a-decision-maker.md)
- What questions should I ask myself before I make a decision?
- What options and methods are available to help me get to a point where I can make a decision?
- How do I deal with being blocked? (balancing / points based - which outweighs the other? How do the scales tip? time sensitivity, risks, reversibility, how long is the tail end? Is this going to impact things years down the road?)
- What types of decisions are there?
- How do I identify the decision maker?
- How do I know I'm aligned with the product/loop/company vision/mission statement?
