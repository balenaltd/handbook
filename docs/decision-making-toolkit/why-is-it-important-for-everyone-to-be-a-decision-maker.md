# Why is it important for everyone to be a decision maker?

Remember that every day at balena is an experiment. With experimenting comes mistakes and that's cool, that's how we learn what works and what doesn't, gain experience and feedback, and hone an ability to make better informed decisions going forward.

To get better at decision making, like everything, you need to practice. This way you begin to spot patterns in decisions that have been made before
