# Why is it important for everyone to be a decision maker?

By having specific individuals doing all the decision making means that we create single points of failure. It requires those individuals to hold far too much context in their heads and burden far too much responsibility, creates unnecessary friction for iterating, experimenting and getting things done, stunts progress, and breeds bureaucracy and gatekeeping. 

But perhaps most importantly it robs people of the ability to learn. Remember that every day at balena is an experiment. With experimenting comes mistakes and that's cool. That's how we learn what works and what doesn't, gain experience and feedback, and hone an ability to make better informed decisions going forward.

To get better at decision making, like everything, you need to practice. This way you begin to spot patterns in decisions that have been made before, and feel more confident in your ability to make the best decision given the circumstances.

## Supporting each other to make decision making easier

It’s also important that we foster an environment where we feel enabled and supported to make decisions. Even with a toolkit, it’s useless if no one feels comfortable using it for fear of judgment and negative reaction.

### Encourage open discussions. 
This can be proactively talking in the open and checking yourself or others when a conversation could be moved to an open forum. 

### Support being open, share thoughts and struggles, and share how we cope with and work through the same problems. 
The more we do this, the more normalize that it’s okay to need help and to actively seek it out, and that we’re often experiencing the same things. This is also useful for finding things that need changing or fixing! 

### Hold each other accountable. 
We should be holding each other to the same high standards. Lead by example, if we see behaviours that make us uncomfortable or wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of, call it out and encourage others to reflect and do better. E.g. being uncooperative, dismissive, inconsiderate. etc

### Celebrate each other's successes and failures. 
We need to remember to celebrate our achievements. A failure is still an achievement because you had to try something first in order to fail.

### If you can’t be positive, try to keep it neutral.
It’s really frustrating when all you want to do is say ‘i told you so!’, make it clear you think something is a bad idea, have to look on whilst a decision is made without us or in spite of our opinion. We have to try to mitigate this as much as possible - because if someone is trying and learning, we’re not offering up anything helpful by sticking the knife in. Instead excuse yourself, scream into the wind, get yourself a treat, then come back and try with something constructive. 

### Enable each other wherever possible. 
We can’t always be a part of the conversation - we have to be able to let stuff go as we can’t do everything all of the time. Single points of failure suck for everyone, so it’s far better that we prepare for others being able to contribute, rather than needing manual input all the time.
