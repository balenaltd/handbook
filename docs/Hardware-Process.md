# Hardware Process

This page documents the Hardware Process that you will use when working on a project that involves some kind of physical hardware - PCB, 3D design, assembly, etc.

## Motivation

One of the chief motivators for starting the Hardware Process project at Balena was to reduce the time spent waiting for prototypes. We realized that we spend a week designing something, and then a month waiting to validate that design (mostly for PCB type projects)

The hardware process intends to be 2 things

- the CI/CD for hardware i.e. software help to build hardware
- a prototyping lab i.e. hardware to help build the software-optimized hardware

## Getting started
You can get started at the [hardware process documentation site](https://landr-balena-io-hardware-repo-hardware-process.netlify.app/)
