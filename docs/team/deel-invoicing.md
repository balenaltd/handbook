# Deel (Invoicing)
We use a payment platform called [Deel](https://www.letsdeel.com/) to pay all contractors on a monthly basis. Using Deel removes the need to send manual invoices, as these are automatically generated, and provides flexibility in getting paid with various transfer options available.

### Getting Started
New team members will receive an invitation via their personal email to register on Deel shortly after they join balena and sign a contract amendment which has the Deel terms and conditions.

The sign up to Deel requires registration as an individual contractor or company, whichever is more relevant.

You will add your personal information and tax details (as well as any other details you need visible on your invoice) and then complete verification using a physical copy of your ID/Passport (they use your camera to verify you).

### Making Withdrawals & Transfer Types
Deel offers various withdrawal methods: Paypal, Payoneer, Revolut and Bank Transfer. There is also the option to make a withdrawal to more than one account. The country you will receive your transfer in and also the currency you are paid in will help you decide which method to choose.

A local bank transfer is the most popular option as Deel uses their local banking partners (generally Transferwise) to reduce transaction and FX fees as much as possible, whilst providing almost instant bank transfers and they offer this for most major currencies. If this is not possible, a SWIFT transfer can be chosen, where the transfer will be received in the currency you are paid and your bank will do the currency exchange. SWIFT transfers do take a little longer to be completed than local transfers. If you are requesting a transfer to an account in your local country but is in another currency, e.g. you are based in Canada but want to receive your transfer in a USD account instead of a CAD account, you must select a SWIFT transfer.
You can choose to add more than one withdrawal method- e.g. a local and a SWIFT transfers, a Paypal and local transfer. If only choosing one withdrawal method, make sure to select the “Automatic Withdrawal” tab so that your payments are automatically made and you don’t need to manually withdraw from your Deel balance.

Transfers from Deel  which are made to local accounts in EUR, GBP and USD have no cost. Local transfers in other currencies and SWIFT transactions are subject to a withdrawal fee, which balena will cover, whether local or SWIFT. For local transfers, these are generally $1-5, and for SWIFT $15-25. When adding your withdrawal method, this fee will be displayed on confirmation of your bank details, and you can let the Finance/Ops team know the cost of this, so it can be added to your payment every month as an Adjustment (with SWIFT fees, this will need to be done retrospectively.)

### Payment Dates & Invoices

You will be paid in your Deel account by the 28th of each month. If you have selected ‘Automatic Withdrawal’ this will be processed by Deel immediately and should arrive in your account within two working days if it’s a local transfer, and five days if it’s a SWIFT transfer.
Once you have been paid, your automated invoice will be available to download after the 28th. As some contractors will need an invoice in a different language or with details specific to their local tax authority, there is an option to upload your own invoice that you have created, should you need to do so.

### Part-time Contractors
As part-time contractors invoice variable amounts depending on how many hours they have worked, they will be required to submit their number of hours worked each month, and this should be done by the 21st of each month.

### Expenses
All expenses should be added to Deel before the 21st of each month using the “Adjust Amount” tool on your personal Deel dashboard. All expenses submitted must be uploaded with a receipt. If the expenses you wish to be reimbursed are in a different currency than the one you use to invoice, then please use the specific day exchange rate, which you can find from the [Historical Currency Rates section of xe.com](https://www.xe.com/currencytables/).

### FAQs
**Where can I find more information about exchange rates?**

This will depend on the type of transfer you choose. If you choose a local transfer, the exchange rates on the day you are paid out from Deel will be the current exchange rate with Transferwise. If you choose a SWIFT payment the exchange rates will be decided by your own bank.

**Will being paid via Deel have any implications on my status as a contractor or have any tax implications?**

No- Deel is simply a third party which manages our payments.

**Can I see a sample invoice, and what do I do if I need to include specific information for my local tax authority?**

Yes- a sample invoice can be found [here](https://fd-files-production.s3.amazonaws.com/189584/puNNjySQYKpe7m3NyDAArQ?X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Date=20200612T123947Z&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIA2QBI5WP5HA3ZEA/20200612/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=744ca5af666d829daeb3bee1e480bc0d787ef4490304c1afe3b9805a8e0f9159) (link broken since 2020-06-12T12:44:47Z). If you need to add any other information or have it in a different language, you can create your own invoice and upload it to replace the Deel automated invoice after you’ve been paid (from the 29th of each month).
 
**What do I do if there is no option to make a local bank transfer in the country I am based in?**

Deel has a wide range of currencies and different countries where they can make local transfers, but in some smaller countries, this won’t be an option. In this case, you can choose to receive a SWIFT transfer, or one of the other options available such as Paypal or Revolut.

**Can I add my own company/tax details?**

Yes, when you register you will have the choice to register as an individual contractor or as a company, and in both cases, you will have the option to add your tax number to appear on your invoice.

**Do I have to use my personal email address to sign up for Deel?**

No, but it is recommended, so that you can continue to have access to your invoices should you leave the company in the future

**Do I have to submit my invoice or any other information each month?**

Only if you have expenses to add, or if you are a part-time contractor who needs to submit their hours. Otherwise, everything is automated and you’ll get paid each by your chosen withdrawal method.

**When will I get paid?**

Your payment should reach Deel by the 28th of each month. If you’ve requested a local bank transfer it should arrive in your bank account within 2 days, if you’ve chosen SWIFT, it will take up to 5 days.

**Why am I getting an error when uploading my name/address/personal information?**

As IBAN transfers only acknowledge the Latin alphabet, any local or language specific spellings will not be recognized in the bank transfer, so ensure that all information is added in the standard Latin alphabet with no special letters or characters.
