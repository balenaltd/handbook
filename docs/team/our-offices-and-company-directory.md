# balena offices
We currently have 2 offices which you can see below. These are mainly used by the balenistas based in those cities and others that visit to work there with teammates. Each office has an office manager to oversee operations and the Athens office is managed by the Ops team.

We have reopened all of our offices after closing due to Covid-19. Please follow local guidelines, details below, to keep them a safe environment for everyone.
