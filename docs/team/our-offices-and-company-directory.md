# balena offices
We currently have 3 offices which you can see below. These are mainly used by the balenistas based in those cities and others that visit to work there with teammates. Each office has an office manager to oversee operations and the Athens office is managed by the Ops team.

As all offices remained closed with very limited access due to covid-19, below are some guidelines/rules/procedures we've put together to make sure we can reopen our offices and keep them a safe environment for everyone.


## Athens office

### Office ReOpen 11th May 2020 

- If you are sick, have a fever, have tested positive for COVID-19, or believe you have been exposed to somebody with COVID-19, don’t schedule to visit the office for at least 14 days, and please cancel if you are scheduled to visit and developed symptoms in the meantime.
- If you can work from home, work from home. Only go into the office if you need to be there to do your work, or pick something up to bring home for your work.
- Limit the amount of time you spend in the office to the minimum needed to accomplish your work.
- If you need the office to do your work, but don’t feel comfortable going into the office, please let us know - nobody should go to the office who doesn’t feel comfortable doing so.
- The office is limited to 3 people in the office at a time for the Ops at the 1st floor and 1 person for the Distribution/Assembly space on the 2nd floor. Please check the calendar and schedule with Hubot/the office calendar at least 24 hours in advance (preferably more) if you are planning to visit the office.
- No visitors are allowed for the time being.
- Whenever you enter the office, please wash your hands thoroughly first thing. There are soap dispensers and paper towels provisioned, as well as hand sanitisers.
- The shared kitchenette is open. Please clean up well after you use anything. Bottled water will be the only provisioning for the time being.
- At each desk there will be individual spray bottles of  hand sanitizers and antibacterial cleaning agents, as well as antibacterial wipes; this is to keep our workspaces/shared contact points separated/minimized. There are also single-use masks as well as nitrile gloves - this is not necessitated but if you would like to. Please keep the provisioning only for use in office purposes.
- At the end of each visit, leave the office a clean and safe space for the next person. Please use the cleaning agent and wipe down contact points - your desk, chair, keyboard/mice, as well as high touch-points like door handles and intercom if you've used it to answer the door.
