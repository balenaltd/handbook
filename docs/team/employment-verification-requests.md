# Employment verification requests
As is common when renting a property, applying for a mortgage, housing lease, bank loan etc. you may need to ask balena to provide an employment reference or confirmation of your personal details and/or salary, relationship with the company.

Weâ€™re happy to do this to help team members when they need some form of verification. The phone number and email address below have been set up to deal with these requests, these details can be provided to any external sources for employment verification, and a member of People-ops will action these when received. Alternatively, if you need a signed letter to verify your personal details, salary and employment to submit yourself, feel free to drop your request in an email or ping @@people-ops in Fibery. Let us know if there is any guidance for this we should follow.
