# Scheduling Ad Hoc Meetings

In addition to the regular calls and brainstorms that are on the Balena Admin calendar, it often becomes necessary for a team member to schedule ad hoc calls with other team members about specific projects. Since we have flexible working hours (as detailed in the [working hours and availability](https://handbook.balena.io/team/working-hours-and-availability) section), it is often non-trivial to find a meeting time that would suit the whole group.

We have an AppSheet-based web app to help balenistas easily create a list of possible meeting times: the [**Balena Ad Hoc Scheduler**](https://www.appsheet.com/start/0cb88813-11be-430e-bc20-19b695b7f667#appName=TeamModel-5695316&page=search&table=UTCAvailabilities&view=Assistant). For detailed instructions on how to use this scheduler, navigate to the `About` section under the app menu in the top left corner.

This app essentially serves as a front-end for quick filtering of the [UK Time Team Availabilities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fOpah2A6N3xImg5xxGbTygdcNRGBlyZ_jQ2UIzy9PLE/edit#gid=1035327337) sheet in the `Current Team Model`, which contains the relevant data: the working hours for the whole team, aligned to UK time by applying their time zones, and with existing calendar events and time off already applied.
