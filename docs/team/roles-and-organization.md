# Roles and Organization

We try to keep the organization as flat and as lightweight as possible, so people are encouraged to take charge of their work independently. We believe that every balenista can lead on their work! 

This doesn’t mean that you’re on your own here. We’ve got your back and altogether we try making our everyday life easier. You will soon see that all balenistas are very approachable and eager to help, so do not hesitate to reach out when needed! When you identify tasks that can be made consistent, you’re encouraged to discuss them with the team, raise them internally, as well as draw up a process to handle them. Will we be doing this often enough to automate it? How could this be automated? How would someone do this if we were double the size we are now? In other words, we are very flexible in solving new problems, but we try to solve them in ways that will be efficient today and scalable in the future. We welcome suggestions and want to hear your ideas! 

As the team grows, we know it can be hard to discover what everyone is working on and who you should reach out to for questions or help around particular projects or elements of your work when needed. We are working on a way to have a dymanic team directory which will help the team have more visibility on that. You can view team members personal repos in the [balenaltd org](https://github.com/balenaltd) or check your teammates profiles on Fibery. Note that completing these is optional so you might not be able to find much for some people. 

Depending on your role and/or the project you are working on, you will have some teammates that you are working closely with that can offer the guidance needed when you are new and support you to learn and settle in. 

You can go to anyone on the leadership team for any questions around personal development or support (e.g. salary, performance). For anything else, you can contact the People-ops team team if it is team specific and they will help you out.

Leadership team & Strategy aspect group
The leadership team is basically our 3 co-CEOs. Along with some other teammates, they form the Strategy aspect group. This is a group of individuals trusted to lead the team strategy and vision of balena.

If you are struggling or you have any concerns and/or feedback to share, we want to hear from you and help! You are welcome to reach out to anyone you feel comfortable discussing with, whether this is one of the people guiding your work or someone at People-ops that can help push your feedback in the right direction.
