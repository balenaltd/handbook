# Keeping your personal information up to date
### Personal information
We record the personal information for every new starter in a confidential folder, maintained by TeamOS. It is therefore very important that you let someone from the Operations or TeamOS team know if you change any of the below. You can also send an email to teamos@balena.io. Even if it is a temporary relocation, it is useful to make a note. 

- your name
- location
- address
- personal contact number & email

This is so we can keep our records up to date and make other relevant changes when needed. For example, a change of name or country might mean that we need to issue a new contract for you. We also rely on our records for orders and deliveries to team members, as well as for maintaining our [team map](https://www.balena.io/team) with pins for all balenistas' locations which we would like to keep tidy and updated.

#### Your team

A subset of the current team's personal information is displayed in the [Current Team Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fOpah2A6N3xImg5xxGbTygdcNRGBlyZ_jQ2UIzy9PLE/edit#gid=404458414), which is a read-only document visible to the whole team. This sheet is a useful resource to consult for your fellow team members' balena contact details, location and availabilities, to name a few.

Note that more sensitive personal information, such as addresses, emergency contacts and contact numbers are stored confidentially, and not displayed to the team in the Current Team Model.

### Preferences

For every new starter, we also create a personal Google sheet, titled `user-<Github-handle>`. You would have received an invite to edit this sheet upon onboarding. It contains some basic preferences that the team member is responsible for maintaining:

#### Working hours

Detailed instructions on how to maintain this section of your personal sheet is provided in the [working hours](./working-hours-and-availability.md) section of this handbook.

#### Birthday preference

Every week during the [All Hands call](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/All-hands-calls) we wish happy birthday to team members. We do understand though that everyone's birth date is private info that not everyone might want to share with the whole team at a call. For that reason, we have made it possible for every team member to indicate whether or not we may share their birthday team-wide.

#### Preferred shift lengths

If you participate in any of our support channel rotations, you should enter your preferred shift length for each relevant channel in this section. Our [support scheduler](https://github.com/people-os/support-shift-scheduler) will do its best to schedule your support hours in chunks matching your preferred shift length as closely as possible. You only need to enter values for channels in which you participate.
