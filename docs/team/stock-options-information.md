# Stock Options

As part of your compensation, you have been given share options. Our board is required to approve all stock option grants which happens when we have a board meeting. Therefore, you might receive the agreement sometime after you have joined. Your grant, however, will still backdate and begin "vesting" on your start date, regardless of when the next board meeting is. We manage the stock options in [Carta](https://carta.com/) and you will receive an invite to set up your account once your agreement has been issued. 

In June 2018 there was an all-hands presentation called [Stock Options 101](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLggEbNspmT4lpnuNoDACcWXDsGO6saM) on how stock options work in general (with some links to resources) and about how stock options work at balena.
