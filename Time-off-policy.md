As to time-off, resin.io team is divided into three groups: 
* [Employees](https://github.com/resin-io/hq/wiki/Employees-(time-off))
* [Full-Time Contractors](https://github.com/resin-io/hq/wiki/Full-time-contractors)
* [Part-Time Contractors](https://github.com/resin-io/hq/wiki/Part-time-contractors)

You'll notice a lot of similarities between the policies and the reason for this is that we tried to create a company-wide, fair, straightforward time-off policy, respecting the needs of the team members.

Here are the main points of the policy:
* The general idea is that all team members have the same holiday allowance, which is 30 days per year.
* This is a 'use it or lose it' policy, which means that someone cannot transfer days to next year's allowance.
* Holiday allowance resets on each team member hire date anniversary.
* Someone can exceed the 30 days annual allowance and get unpaid holidays. _(psst! If you run out of days but your anniversary date is close, request your holiday as usual and there's a great chance you borrow some days from your future holiday allowance)_
* Despite the nature of the day (business day, bank holiday, national day etc) a time-off request has to be submitted.

Regardless the group that you fall in, it’s really important that whenever you want to take some days off, you first check with the team and make sure that someone has got your back. For example, if a team consists of 2 people, it won’t be a good idea for both of them to be away at the same time. Speak to your colleague and make sure that someone will always have you covered. Think about others, protect your colleagues, protect the company.

Finally, please make sure that you place a time-off request using Calamari, the leave management service we're using.
