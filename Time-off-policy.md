Some of this policy is specific to your employment status: employee, full-time contractor, part-time contractor. Much of the policy is similar for everyone, and the reason for this is that we tried to create a company-wide, fair, straightforward time-off policy, respecting the needs of the team members. The general idea is that all team members have the same holiday allowance, which is 30 days per year. You can read more about the specifics that apply to you and FAQ below the general policy.

### The general policy
* Before requesting time off, you are responsible for checking with your team(s) to see how your time-off affects the project(s) you're working on (preferably in the flow your team uses and not 1-to-1) and have made sure that someone will be covering for you, prior to your time-off request.
* you need to give two weeks notice for time off longer than one day, because the Ops team will make sure we always have the necessary skeleton crew needed to run resin, and for some folks this affects the support scheduling. If you have an emergency or really good reason to not give two weeks notice, request your time off and add a note to your request explaining the situation (eg. "My cat died", or "I decided to switch to Windows 8").
* If you're taking just one day off, please request it as soon as you are able to, as the Ops team still checks the resin skeleton crew.
* Holiday allowance resets on each team member hire date anniversary.
* If you have days left at the end of your year, it's possible to transfer them to the next year. Ask the Ops team about rolling them over.
* If you are reaching the end of your year and have already used your 30 days annual allowance, you can ask the Ops team about taking unpaid days off. _(psst! If you run out of days but your anniversary date is close, ask the Ops team, as there is a great chance you can borrow some days from your future holiday allowance)_
* Despite the nature of the day (business day, bank holiday, national day etc) a time-off request has to be submitted.

### FAQ
**How do I check with my team before taking time off?**

Speak to your colleague and make sure that someone will always have you covered. Think about others, protect your colleagues, protect the company. Note that the Ops team will be asking you about it at the time you submit a time-off request. For example, if a team consists of 2 people, it wonâ€™t be a good idea for both of them to be away at the same time. 

** What if I need to take time off but it's less than two weeks? Are you going to grant it?**

There are a number of unpredictable reasons to need to ask for last-minute time off. If there's an emergency, email Apostolis and we'll sort the rest out later. If you find yourself in a non-emergency situation where you aren't able give proper notice, you still need to make sure you can leave your team and projects without major disruption. When you apply for the time off, be sure to include a reason for the last-minuteness.

The purposes of the two-week notification is to ensure that we maintain a fully operational status at all times and make certain that there is someone to treat any urgent matter that may arise. We want to grant your time off, so if you do your best, we'll do ours.

** How do I request and manage my time-off?**
