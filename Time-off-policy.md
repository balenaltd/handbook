As to time-off, resin.io team is divided into three groups: 
* [Employees](https://github.com/resin-io/hq/wiki/Employees-(time-off))
* [Full-Time Contractors](https://github.com/resin-io/hq/wiki/Full-time-contractors)
* [Part-Time Contractors](https://github.com/resin-io/hq/wiki/Part-time-contractors)

You'll notice a lot of similarities between the policies and the reason for this is that we tried to create a company-wide, fair, straightforward time-off policy, respecting the needs of the team members.

Here are the main points of the policy:
* The general idea is that all team members have the same holiday allowance, which is 30 days per year.
* Holiday allowance resets on each team member hire date anniversary.
* If you have days left at the end of your year, it's possible to transfer them to the next year. Ask the Ops team about rolling them over.
* If you are reaching the end of your year and have already used your 30 days annual allowance, you can ask the Ops team about taking unpaid days off. _(psst! If you run out of days but your anniversary date is close, request your holiday as usual and there's a great chance you borrow some days from your future holiday allowance)_
* Despite the nature of the day (business day, bank holiday, national day etc) a time-off request has to be submitted.

Regardless the group that you fall in, it’s really important to ensure that whenever you want to take some days off (5+ days), you have taken the time to have a discussion with your team members (preferably in the flow your team uses and not 1-to-1) and have made sure that someone will be covering for you, prior to your time-off request.

For example, if a team consists of 2 people, it won’t be a good idea for both of them to be away at the same time. Speak to your colleague and make sure that someone will always have you covered. Think about others, protect your colleagues, protect the company. Note that the Ops team will be asking you about it at the time you submit a time-off request.

Of course, family, health and other unpredictable emergencies are excluded from the above requirement. Just for clarification purposes, we would like to say that the reason we are doing this is to ensure that we maintain a fully operational status at all times and make certain that there is someone to treat any urgent matter that may arise.

Finally, please make sure that you place a time-off request using Calamari, the leave management service we're using.
