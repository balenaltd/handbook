As to time-off, resin.io team is divided into three groups: 
* Employees
* Full-Time Contractors
* Part-Time Contractors

You'll notice a lot of similarities between the policies and the reason for this is that we tried to create a company-wide, fair, straightforward time-off policy, respecting the needs of the team members.

Here are the main points of the policy:
* The general idea is that all team members have the same holiday allowance, which is 30 days per year.
* This is a 'use it or lose it' policy, which means that someone cannot transfer days to next year's allowance.
* Someone can exceed the 30 days annual allowance and get unpaid holidays.
* Despite the nature of the day (business day, bank holiday, national day etc) a time-off request has to be submitted.
* Holiday allowance resets on each team member hire date anniversary.
