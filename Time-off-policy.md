Some of this policy is specific to your employment status: employee, full-time contractor, part-time contractor. Much of the policy is similar for everyone, and the reason for this is that we tried to create a company-wide, fair, straightforward time-off policy, respecting the needs of the team members. The general idea is that all team members have the same holiday allowance, which is 30 days per year. You can read more about the specifics that apply to you and FAQ below the general policy.

### The general policy
* Before requesting time off, you are responsible for checking with your team(s) to see how your time-off affects the project(s) you're working on (preferably in the flow your team uses and not 1-to-1) and have made sure that someone will be covering for you, prior to your time-off request.
* When requesting in Calamari, include weekends. They don't count as PTO, and they help the Ops team know how much time you're taking in one block.
* If you request one day off: please request it as soon as you are able to, as Ops still checks the resin skeleton crew.
* If you request is for two to 14 days: you need to give two weeks notice for time off. If you have an emergency or really good reason to not give two weeks notice, request your time off and add a note to your request explaining the situation (eg. "My cat died", or "I decided to switch to Windows 8").
* Any requests for more than 14 days in one go are considered an exception. They require an OK from the strategy team, and at least four weeks notice.
* Holiday allowance resets on each team member hire date anniversary.
* If you have days left at the end of your year, you may be able to transfer some of them to the next year. This is judged on a case-by-case basis. Ask the Ops team about this.
* If you are reaching the end of your year and have already used your 30 days annual allowance, you can ask the Ops team about taking unpaid days off. _(psst! If you run out of days but your anniversary date is close, ask the Ops team, as there is a great chance you can borrow some days from your future holiday allowance)_
* Despite the nature of the day (business day, bank holiday, national day etc) a time-off request has to be submitted.
* If you are attending an event where you are speaking, presenting, or representing balena, you do not need to take time off. (Also, your travel can be covered too!)
* If you're going to a professional conference or event and would like balena to consider providing the time off, please send a message to Alison, including a link to the conference, and a bit about what professional development it's providing.

### FAQ
**How do I check with my team before taking time off?**

Speak to your colleague and make sure that someone will always have you covered. Think about others, protect your colleagues, protect the company. Note that the Ops team will be asking you about it at the time you submit a time-off request. For example, if a team consists of 2 people, it wonâ€™t be a good idea for both of them to be away at the same time. 

**Why do I need to give two weeks notice for my time off?**

The purposes of the two-week notification is to ensure that we maintain a fully operational status (like support scheduling) at all times and make certain that there is someone to treat any urgent matter that may arise. We want to grant your time off, so if you do your best, we'll do ours.

There are a number of unpredictable reasons to need to ask for last-minute time off. If there's an emergency, email Apostolis and we'll sort the rest out later. If you find yourself in a non-emergency situation where you aren't able give proper notice, you still need to make sure you can leave your team and projects without major disruption. When you apply for the time off, be sure to include a reason for the last-minuteness.


**How do I request and manage my time-off?**

Request time-off using Calamari, the leave management service we're using. Read this [short Calamari getting started guide](https://docs.google.com/a/resin.io/document/d/1tSKx8T78QFJMOzXrqIKcN7lwEPM41VbBG7B_ILEOkBQ/edit?usp=sharing) to find your way around it.
