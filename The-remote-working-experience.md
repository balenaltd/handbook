## What is a good place to work from?

Below you can see from our experience over the years what we consider a good place to work from. 
- enough equipment around you to perform any work duties you have, and enough space to use them in
- reliable internet connection, enough for video
- quiet place to take calls from
- a working environment that doesn't compromise your productivity and gives you long stretches of distraction-free time to work
- a fixed address where the ops team can send you parcels if needed
- advance notice and approval when it comes to shifting timezones and working days significantly.
- ability to meet all your standard obligations like team checkins, all hands calls, applicable brainstorms, etc
