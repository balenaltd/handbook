Announcement for Seattle Office ReOpen June 1,  2020 

Here are the guidelines/procedures we've put together to make sure we can reopen the office and keep it a safe environment for everyone.

If you are sick, have a fever, have tested positive for COVID-19, or believe you have been exposed to somebody with COVID-19, don’t schedule to visit the office for at least 14 days, and please cancel if you are scheduled to visit and develop symptoms in the meantime.
If you can work from home, work from home. Only go into the office if you need to be there to do your work and schedule your time on the Seattle office calendar so others are aware of your presence in the office.
Limit the amount of time you spend in the office to the minimum needed to accomplish your work.
If you need the office to do your work, but don’t feel comfortable going into the office, please let us know - nobody should go to the office who doesn’t feel comfortable doing so.
The office is limited to one person in the office at a time, with a 30min buffer between visits. Please check the Seattle calendar and schedule with Hubot/the office calendar at least 24 hours in advance (preferably more) if you are planning to visit the office.
If for some reason there are 2 or more employees in the office at the same time (scheduling conflict or mis-communication) keep 6ft of distance from one another. 
No visitors are allowed in the office for the time being.
Whenever you enter the office, please wash your hands thoroughly first thing. There will be a touchless soap dispenser and paper towels provisioned, as well as hand sanitizer.
Each desk will have its own hand sanitizer bottle (waiting on more to ship to us sometime in June/July) as well as antibacterial wipes; this is to keep our workspaces/shared contact points separated/minimized. There will also be single-use masks as well as gloves in the office - these are not required for wearing but available if you’d like to use them while in office/in transition to and from office. Please do not remove these items for personal use (for office related purposes). 
At the end of each visit, leave the office a clean and safe place for the next person. Please use the cleaning agents and or wipes on your desk, chair, keyboard/mice, as well as high touch-points like door handles, light switches, the kitchen sink handle, fridge handle and office doorknobs.
