*This is the support process we used for the Nov 2016 summit.*

When users open Intercom, user see this "away" message:
>The resin team is traveling till Nov 14 so our support is limited. We are focusing on critical issues for paid customers. In lieu, see our forums: talk.resin.io

Relatedly, our plan is to roll out community-only support for most unpaid users. We're not shoving them off into the bush. We're going to make a concerted effort to build up forum support. To start, that means a closer eye on the responses from community members, to help guide them when they're incorrect. For users, we'll want to cultivate a set of "time to bring them to 1:1" scenarios. (Bricking a device is a good start.

As we receive Intercom messages, we'll want to triage and respond quickly. It's quite possible they didn't absorb our away message, so we want to set their expectations. It's a lot easier to do that right after they sent the message, rather than hours later.

####What are we defining as critical?

Above all else, use your own judgement. This is a super vague delineation we're making. Some ideas include
* if they have a bricked device
* if they have a problem that halts their overall work
* bonus points if they are a partner or critical customer

They'll be able to respond if they think differently, or have more information that escalates a ticket, so don't worry too much about getting it wrong based on the information you have.

###There are three main responses to an Intercom message during Summit:

####For unpaid users
Check that they're not a paid customer first. 

>Once a year our remote team gets together(1) to improve our systems and processes, all in the name of resin. We will focus our extremely limited support time on mission-critical issues for paid customers.

>Since we have such limited availability, users (like yourself) who are using the free launch plan(2) will need to rely on our community forums:
https://talk.resin.io/

>Up to now we've been providing chat and email support to all users, and we can't hold up the load while also having an all-hands summit week. Don't worry, we'll be in forums with you and the rest of the community to help answer questions well!

>All of us will be back home (and back to business) Monday, November 14.

>Cheers,
>Resin

The reason to strongly word this is to also socialize them on the idea that we have the option of not providing 1:1 support to them. If they respond with a request to help them just this once, unless it is our fault, we need to reply with a firm reminder that this is the level of support they get with a free account, and link to the forums.

####For paid users
If their issue is not critical, use this canned response. Since they will be unsure if we'll be responding to it as critical or not, it'll be good to get this response to them as quickly as we can.

#####Non-critical issues

>Once a year our [remote team gets together](https://resin.io/blog/how-we-run-a-remote-team/) to improve our systems and processes, all in the name of resin. We are focusing our extremely limited support time on mission-critical issues for paid customers. 

>Since we have such limited availability, we're asking all users to rely on our [community forums](talk.resin.io) for non-critical issues. Don't worry, we'll be in forums with you and the rest of the community to help answer questions well!

>We've looked at your issue, and from what we can tell, it does not appear to be mission critical. Please check out the [community forums](talk.resin.io) for an answer or ask about it there. If it's not time sensitive, we can look at it after November 14. **If this is a critical issue, please respond and tell us as much as you can about it, so we can quickly and efficiently help you.**

>All of us will be back home (and back to business) Monday, November 14.

#####Critical issues
The customer will be wondering if we are going to deem it critical. Responding to confirm we are attending to their ticket will make this clear. If you're planning to respond anyway, perhaps include a "This is a critical issue, and I'm happy to help."

Otherwise, quick send them this response.

>Although we're all traveling for our [company summit](https://resin.io/blog/how-we-run-a-remote-team/), we are focusing our extremely limited support time on mission-critical issues like this. We'll respond again as soon as we have the right questions or answers for you.
