You may be required to travel, from time to time, for business purposes such as events, team meetings, meetings with customers etc. The company will cover all work-related travel expenses. This includes accommodation and meals for the business trip. We really want our team members to be productive and not need to worry about travel arrangements and stuff.

The company can accommodate custom requests. It is OK to stay longer on your trip. However, the extra days will not be covered by the company.

_Always have proof of ID and a credit/debit card with you._ Hotels will generally expect you to have a physical credit card to present upon check-in. This credit card will be kept on file for the duration of your stay. Even if your lodging was prepaid by the company or by using a company credit card, the Hotel may still require a card to be on file for "incidentals".
Please note that we are trying to minimize the effort you need to put on this, thus we try to prepaid for all travel arrangements.


## How should I book my flight & accommodation? 
In order to book your flights & accommodation please first get in touch with the Operations Team. Contact the Operations team using @@operations in the `t/operations` flow. If your trip has been discussed in a different flow, it is always useful to link it for context. Operations will help you with your flight and accommodation for your trip. We currently use [Travelperk](https://www.travelperk.com/) for booking flights and accommodation, so you will most likely be advised to book everything through there and Operations can approve. 

If you are traveling to Seattle to work from the _Seattle office_, we have a corporate agreement with a Hotel nearby, so let the Operations Team know and they will book a room for you. Note that you will need to provide proof of ID and a credit card for any incidentals.

## How should I pay for my expenses while I'm traveling?

All the expenses made for the duration of your business travel are covered by balena. For clarification purposes, these expenses include accommodation, food, business meals, transport and any unforeseen hardware required to perform the task at hand. Accommodation most of the time is prepaid or handled by the Operations Team. Meals, transportation and other expenses are paid by the employee and reimbursed. You can submit expenses through Expensify if you are an employee or Deel if you are a contractor. 

## What happens in case of an emergency?

In case of an emergency, the first thing you need to do is get in touch with the Operations Team. Don’t hesitate to contact Apostolis (apostolis@balena.io), Stefanos (stefanos@balena.io) or Fotis (fotis@balena.io) via email or in the operations flow in Flowdock. In case of an emergency, don't hesitate to call them on their mobile phones (Apostolis +30 6946913376, Stefanos +30  6936896999, Fotis +30 6979180161). They will guide you in any way possible.
In the unlikely event that the Operations Team is not available to assist you (that would occur only due to time difference), and depending on the need, there are a few things you can do. Please see below.

### Accommodation

In case the emergency requires an employee to pay for something that was supposed to be handled by balena (eg Hotel room), but for an unpredictable reason, it wasn’t, then the employee will be reimbursed as soon as the Operations Team receives the expense report. 

## Do I have travel insurance?

Travelperk offers travel insurance and we normally have this set up by default. In case of an emergency, the first thing you need to do is get in touch with the Operations team. 

## How do I submit my expense report and when will it get reimbursed?

You may be required to pay for business expenses, from time to time. Reported expenses are submitted to the financial team for approval and are reimbursed with payroll or invoice payment, usually at the end of each month. In cases where the value of expenses is high, the company will make every effort to reimburse the employee in the shortest time possible.

For the time being, employees forward all their expenses via Expensify and contractors via Deel. Note that you should always keep a copy of the receipt in order to expense it. 

Another important note is that when you submit a Travel expense, under the “department” option or the notes/comment section, use the reason for traveling. If you are traveling for marketing purposes use “marketing”. In case you are traveling for “sales” purposes then use “sales. Here are a few examples:

Let’s say a Software Engineer is asked to Travel to present a demo for a sales pitch. Even though the Engineer is under the “Engineering” department, for this travel specifically he/she should mark everything expensed under “Sales” department.
The same would happen if a Software Engineer was asked to go to an event. They would mark all expenses under the “Marketing” department.
 
In addition please add a reason for the expense, under “comment”, if it is not related to an Event.

Please check out [this Expensify guide](https://docs.expensify.com/setup-for-submitters/day-1-with-expensify-submitters) or [this Deel guide](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Deel-(Invoicing)) before forwarding any expenses.


## How do I submit expenses in a foreign currency

When you expense something in a foreign currency (other than the currency you are getting paid in), we suggest that you expense the amount that appears in your bank statement. That will include any relevant fees (conversion) and what you pay for the interbank rate.

## Is there a limit on the money I can spend on food while I'm traveling?

In balena, we’re trying to maintain a friendly environment to work in. Thus, we have decided not to put a spending limit for employees on food. However, let’s not forget that balena is still a startup. Just for reference, an amount of 50$ per person is within reasonable standards (10$ Breakfast, 15$ Lunch, and 20$ Dinner). This is a sample of goodwill from balena towards its employees that a sensible way of spending money when traveling is embraced. 

On the other hand, please note that all expenses are reviewed and any expense considered not to be reimbursable will be left out. 

For example, if you go out to a restaurant, while you’re on a trip for balena, be as reasonable as possible and spend as much as you would spend if you were paying out of your own pocket. That kind of expense will be reimbursed with no problem.

On the other hand, if you decide to go to the cinema or eat at a 2 Michelin star awarded restaurant, while you are on a trip for balena, then that expense will not be reimbursed.

On a side note, if you're submitting expenses for you and other team members, please don't forget to mention that while submitting your expense report.

## What kind of expenses are acceptable?

Please take a look at the acceptable expenses below. Note that for any expense you are not certain whether it’s reimbursable or not don’t hesitate to contact the Operations team before making any purchase. 

In addition please try to manage your budget as best as you can. For example, get a taxi when you are more than 2 people but check public transportation (to see if it is around about the same time) when you are alone. 

### Food
 
Breakfast, if not included in the accommodation, as well as lunch, dinner, coffee, and snacks in between. 
Dinner for example at a restaurant is a reimbursable expense while a glass of wine with a city view on top of the Space Needle in Seattle is not reimbursable. 

### Transport 

Taxi, train, bus or rental car costs for all the transport required for the duration of the travel. 
Taking the train to and from the airport when traveling for balena is an expense that will be reimbursed. On the other hand, a ticket for a rollercoaster ride is not :)

### Business meetings 

Any cost related to a business meeting that has not been handled by the Operations Team. From renting an office for a day to taking a client to a business meal.  

### Hardware 

In case an employee needed to purchase Hardware that either was not foreseen or couldn’t be transported then the employee will be reimbursed for that purchase. 
If you are at an event for example and you buy a board because the one that you are using for a demo has malfunctioned, that will be reimbursed. Buying a new PlayStation controller because the one you had brought with you broke, is not a reimbursable expense. 

### Emergencies

In case an emergency requires a purchase please don’t hesitate to contact the Operations team.
Let’s say that you got sick when on a journey with balena and you need medicine. That purchase is reimbursable. A flight adjustment to get back in time for the Super Bowl opening is not an expense that can be reimbursed, sorry guys :(
