You may be required to travel, from time to time, for business purposes such as events, meetings with customers etc. The company will cover all work-related travel expenses. This includes lodging and meals for the business trip. We really want our team members to be productive and not need to worry about travel arrangements and stuff.

The company can accommodate custom requests. It is OK to stay longer on your trip. However, the extra days will not be covered by the company.

Always have a credit/debit card with you. Hotels will generally expect you to have a physical credit card to present upon check-in. This credit card will be kept on file for the duration of your stay. Even if your lodging was prepaid by the company or by using a company credit card, the Hotel may still require a card to be on file for "incidentals".
Please note that we are trying to minimize the effort you need to put on this, thus we are using NexTravel for our travel arrangements.

Using NexTravel is quite easy and very similar to the way you book flights and hotels commercially. The steps are very easy:

- Find the flight or hotel you wish.
- Double check your reservation dates, personal info etc. are all correct.

- Complete your reservation by clicking the "Complete Checkout" button.

- When you complete your request, an approval email will be sent to the Operations team.
- Once approved, you'll receive a confirmation email with all your reservation details.

Once it is checked by the Operations Team and all seems fine you receive your approval. In case of an emergency before or during your travels the NexTravel support team is available 24/7 by phone +1-844-800-9855 or via email support@nextravel.com.

Moreover, NexTravel offers a number of features that include also a centralize Open Booking functionality. The Open Booking feature allows you to import reservations, that were booked outside of NexTravel, into the NexTravel platform. This feature allows you to keep all of your reservations and bookings centralized and share them also with the team.

Do not hesitate to reach out to our Operations team in case you need any additional information or any clarification.

## How should I book my accommodation?

In order to book your accommodation you first get in touch with the Operations Team. They will guide you whether you need to book a hotel room by yourself or if the Operations Team will arrange accommodation on your behalf. 

The Ops team would book your accommodation in case more extensive research is required or the booking cannot be performed using Nextravel. Airbnb reservations also go through the Ops team.

## How should I pay for my expenses while I'm travelling?

All the expenses made for the duration of your business travel is covered by balena. For clarification purposes these expenses include accommodation, food, business meals, transport and any unforeseen H/W required to perform the task at hand. 
Accommodation most of the times is prepaid or handled by the Operations Team. Meals, transportation and other expenses are paid by the employee and reimbursed.

## What happens in case of emergency?

In case of an emergency the first thing you need to do is get in touch with the Operations Team. Don’t hesitate to contact Apostolis (apostolis@balena.io), Stefanos (stefanos@balena.io) or Fotis (fotis@balena.io) via email or in the operations flow in Flowdock. In case of an emergency, don't hesitate to call them on their mobile phones (Apostolis +30 6946913376, Stefanos +30  6936896999, Fotis +30 6979180161) They will guide you in any way possible.
In the unlikely event that the Operations Team is not available to assist you (that would occur only due to time difference), and depending on the need, there are a few things you can do. Please see below.

### Travel

If the emergency for example is Travel related (flight cancellation, adjustments etc.), you can always phone NexTravel and let them figure out and straighten out any issues that have risen. NexTravel support team is available 24/7 by phone +1-844-800-9855 or via email to support@nextravel.com

### Accommodation

In case the emergency requires an employee to pay for something that was supposed to be handled by balena (eg Hotel room), but for unpredictable reason it wasn’t, then the employee will be reimbursed as soon as the Operations Team receives the expense report.

## Do I have travel insurance?

All Balena, Inc. employees (US) are covered by travel insurance. You can check out the blue card [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_LBJM6eLHa6kiCzCK8VGBYj6Ii3cEbR_). In case of an emergency the first thing you need to do is get in touch with the Operations Team. 

## How do I submit my expense report and when will it get reimbursed?

You may be required to pay for business expenses, from time to time. You are responsible for seeking authorization from the Management or Operations team for any expenses made for business purposes, prior to spending any money, even if expenses of the same type have been repeatedly approved in the past. 

Authorization can be obtained with a simple message in Flowdock or just an email request. Expenses made must be reported to the Operations team together with all relevant invoices/receipts. Reported expenses are submitted to the financial team for approval and are reimbursed with payroll or invoice payment, usually at the end of each month. In cases where the value of expenses is high, the company will make every effort to reimburse the employee in the shortest time possible.

For the time being, employees forward all their expenses via a service we use, called Expensify. Note that you should always keep a copy of the receipt in order to expense it. 

Another important note is that when you submit a Travel expense, under the “department” option, use the reason for traveling. If you are traveling for marketing purposes use “marketing”. In case you are traveling for “sales” purposes then use “sales. Here are a few examples:

Let’s say a Software Engineer is asked to Travel to present a demo for a sales pitch. Even though the Engineer is under the “Engineering” department, for this travel specifically he/she should mark everything expensed under “Sales” department.
The same would happen if a Software Engineer was asked to go to an event. He/She would mark all expenses under the “Marketing” department.

In addition please add a reason for the expense, under “comment”, if it is not related to an Event.

Please check out [this guide](https://docs.expensify.com/setup-for-submitters/day-1-with-expensify-submitters) before forwarding any expenses.

## Is there a limit on the money I can spend on food while I'm traveling?

In balena, we’re trying to maintain a friendly environment to work in. Thus, we have decided not to put a spending limit for employees on food. However, let’s not forget that balena is still a startup. Just for reference, an amount of 45$ per person is within logical standards (10$ BF, 15$ Lunch, and 20$ Dinner). This is a sample of goodwill from balena towards its employees that a sensible way of spending money when traveling is embraced. 

On the other hand, please note that all expenses are reviewed and any expense considered not to be reimbursable will be left out. 

For example, if you go out to a restaurant, while you’re on a trip for balena, be as reasonable as possible and spend as much as you would spend if you were paying out of your own pocket. That kind of expense will be reimbursed with no problem.

On the other hand, if you decide to go to the cinema or eat at a 2 Michelin stars awarded restaurant, while you are on a trip for balena, then that expense will not be reimbursed.

## What kind of expenses are acceptable?

Please take a look at the acceptable expenses below. Note that for any expense you are not certain whether it’s reimbursable or not don’t hesitate to contact the Operations team before making any purchase. 

In addition please try to manage your budget as best as you can. For example, get a taxi when you are more than 2 people but check public transportation (to see if it is around about the same time) when you are alone. 

### Food
 
Breakfast, if not included in the accommodation, as well as lunch, dinner, coffee, and snacks in between. 
Dinner for example at a restaurant is a reimbursable expense while a glass of wine with a city view on top of the Space Needle in Seattle is not reimbursable. 

### Transport 

Taxi, train, bus or rental car costs for all the transport required for the duration of the travel. 
Taking the train to and from the airport when traveling for balena is an expense that will be reimbursed. On the other hand, a ticket for a rollercoaster ride is not :)

### Business meetings 

Any cost related to a business meeting that has not been handled by the Operations Team. From renting an office for a day to taking a client to a business meal.  

### Hardware 

In case an employee needed to purchase Hardware that either was not foreseen or couldn’t be transported then the employee will be reimbursed for that purchase. 
If you are at an event for example and you buy a board because the one that you are using for a demo has malfunctioned, that will be reimbursed. Buying a new PlayStation controller because the one you had brought with you broke, is not a reimbursable expense. 

### Emergencies

In case an emergency requires a purchase please don’t hesitate to contact the Operations team.
Let’s say that you got sick when on a journey with balena and you need medicine. That purchase is reimbursable. A flight adjustment to get back in time for the Super Bowl opening is not an expense that can be reimbursed, sorry guys :( 

## Can I use NexTravel to book a personal trip?

The short answer is yes. You just need to follow the same procedure you follow for booking a business trip. Search for your flights/accommodation/etc., choose the option that satisfies you more, confirm the passenger details and click on the "Continue to Checkout" button. At the next screen, you would see the details of your trip and the total cost. By default, this is set to be a business related trip. If you wish to make this a personal trip, you need to click on the "Personal Trip" checkbox at the top right of your screen. By choosing this option, you will be required to add your payment information and complete checkout, using your personal information. 

For the avoidance of any doubt, booking personal travel and anything related to it (payment, visa, accommodation, expenses etc) is your own responsibility.
