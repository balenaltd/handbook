# Online Services
**How do I get access to the balena.io admin dashboard?**<br>
In order to get access to the balena.io admin dashboard you first need to create accounts to both [balena.io](https://www.balena.io/) and balena-staging.io(https://www.balena-staging.io/), using your @balena.io e-mail account. Then you have to request access in the r/devops flow by mentioning a member of the DevOps team (Jack Brown @brownjohnf, Pagan Gazzard @page). Don’t forget to mention to them that you have created the required accounts.

**How do I join a flow on Flowdock?** <br>
If you click on the "+" sign on the down left of your screen you will see a list of the available flows. click on the flow you need access to and you'll join it automatically. If you haven't done so yet, please take some time to read our [getting started with Flowdock](https://github.com/balena-io/balena/wiki/Flowdock) guide.

**If the purpose of a flow is not immediately obvious, is there a way of finding out what it’s for?** <br>
You can find out what the flow you are interested in is all about by clicking on the cog icon next to the flow name. Press “settings” and there you can see the description of the flow.

# Travel
**Is there a travel policy? Do I book my tickets/accommodation on my own or should I ask someone?** <br>
We use a service called NexTravel for our business travel needs. It’s a very user-friendly and easy to use online service. You book tickets and accommodation by your own and the automated system charges the company card.<br>

We do not have a strict travel policy but all bookings must be approved. Thus said, it is for the best interest of everyone to try and find the best travel solution when booking tickets and accommodation for both the company and the team members. Not the cheapest and most tiring but at the same time, not the most expensive.

# Purchases/Expenses
**If I need hardware for testing purposes can I order it through the company or will I need to buy it myself?** <br>
The company can order it and ship it directly to you! Just let the operations team know what you need, in Flowdock, in r/operations. In any case, if you ever need to pay something out of your own pocket, for business purposes, make sure you keep the receipt and expense it afterward.

**How can I expense a business related purchase?** <br>
Depending on the business relationship you have with the company, you can either use Expensify or add the expense to your invoice. Note that you should always keep a copy of the receipt in order to expense it.

**What’s the expense policy of the company?** <br>
Pretty simple. Everything related to the company and used for the company can be expensed. Anything acquired for personal use doesn’t get reimbursed. Note, that you should check with the operations team before you place an order. 

# Holidays
**Do I need to book off national bank holidays as paid leave or is that handled automatically?** <br>
You will be required to book any time-off you take, including bank holidays, in advance. See more info about the time-off policy in https://github.com/balena-io/balena/wiki/Time-off-policy . <br>
It's your choice, whether you want to work on a national bank holiday or not, however, we'd strongly suggest booking all national holidays, though.

**What is the name of the time off manager that we use? I’ve lost it in my inbox.** <br>
The time-off manager service we're using is called Calamari. This is the service you should use whenever you want to check your holiday allowance or make a time-off request. If, for whatever reason, you're having issues using that service, please let the operations team know and they'll assist you.

# Daily Job
**Do I have to report the number of hours I work?** <br>
No, nobody will ever ask you how many hours you have worked. On the other hand, you are expected to meet any milestones or deadlines you have agreed to and deliver your job on time. 

**How am I assigned work?**

**Which meetings or calls should I attend?** <br>
You're welcome to join any meeting you're interested in. Other than the Monday company call when everyone is required to attend you will need to attend meetings according to your duties. For more info on meetings and what they’re all about please check out the https://github.com/balena-io/balena/wiki/Meetings as well as the [balena.io admin calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=admin%40resin.io).

**Am I on a probationary period?** <br>
No, we don't formally have a probationary period. <br>
There's always a period that new team members need to adjust to the tech and workflow, though.

**When am I paid, and will I be paid this month?** <br>
All employees but US employees get paid on a monthly basis and Payments are done within the last few days of each month. US employees on the contrary get paid bimonthly. <br>
That includes the first month as well, regardless of your starting date. You will get paid for the days you worked rather than a month’s salary.
