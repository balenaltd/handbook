You may be required to pay for business expenses, from time to time. You are responsible for seeking authorization from the Management or Operations team for any expenses made for business purposes, prior to spending any money, even if expenses of the same type have been repeatedly approved in the past. Authorization can be obtained with a simple message in Flowdock or just an e-mail request. 

Expenses made must be reported to the Operations team together with all relevant invoices/receipts. Reported expenses are submitted to the financial team for approval and are reimbursed with payroll or invoice payment, usually at the end of each month. In cases where the value of expenses is high, the company will make every effort to reimburse the employee in the shortest time possible. 

Please read on for more info depending if you are an employee or a contractor.

##Contractors
