Specs are an important tool to help us define and clarify improvements we want to make to our products. They also serve as a strategic guide during the process of implementing improvements to our product, and help communicate what we're working on and why to other members of the team. 

Before embarking on a new project, we should use a spec to determine what problem we are solving and for whom. We should also describe the proposed improvement we want to make, provide implementation details, and share a plan for building and releasing the improvement, complete with expected milestones. 

The spec template can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbNG02zdhHlIvSQPCWbSAgSCUzrO-i5FJAei9wSeU6Y/edit#). Specs are often written collaboratively, with lots of feedback and iteration cycles, and often generate topics for [brainstorms](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Brainstorm-calls) or ad-hoc calls where further discussion and clarification is needed. Specs are living documents and should be updated as the work they describe progresses. They should contain the latest high-level understanding of a product improvement and have enough context for anybody to understand what is being built and why. 

There are two presentations on the spec writing process [here](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/All-hands-presentations#thu-nov-14-2019-how-to-write-a-spec) and [here](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/All-hands-presentations#thu-dec-19-2019-collaborating-on-specs).
