## Introduction
At resin.io we do support differently - firstly, every engineer does it, and secondly we treat it as about the best source of data on our product we have. In support you see exactly the problems users are facing, how they are using our product and what we need to improve.
If you're interested in the philosophy behind this approach, check out our [Support-driven Development blog post](https://resin.io/blog/support-driven-development/) which goes into a lot more detail.

## How is support assigned?
**This is on pause. See Who Is On Support This Week for the details**
Each week we assign 4 engineers to each watch a 4 hour period during their work day. This allows us to cover a 16 hour period from 07:00 - 23:00 (UTC) ever day.
We try to choose who does support as fairly as we can by manually scoring conversations based on effort and quality. We use the sum of this score divided by the number of weeks worked to rank employees in the [Support League Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SUMuvULnDWc1kOeEtbuZXahyA_8SPKcLOCwkRhia1Wo). The 4 engineers for the week are selected based on their score and their timezone availability.

We feel this is a fair measurement as it doesn't disadvantage people who've only recently joined or ignore work done in the past by people who have been here longer, and spreads the work evenly across the team.

### Accumulating extra points
You can do support outside of a support week to gain additional points, we are happy for people to jump in whenever they would like to.

### Weekend cover
We run a voluntary system for weekend support cover - you get double points on the weekend, and each weekend you keep an eye on support you will receive an extra 1/2 day's annual leave to use as you wish (if you cover a single day you receive 1/4 day.)
Weekend cover isn't expected to be as intense as weekday work, rather you make sure you quickly respond to requests for at least 8 hours for each of the days. Some weekends this can involve little to no work, others more but it's always significantly less than weekday volumes.

## Getting set up
1. Make sure you have accounts at the following place, ask Apostolis (@apostolism) if you don't:
    * [Zendesk](https://resin.zendesk.com/agent/filters/69240918) - Premium support and most important to keep on top of. 
    * [Front](https://app.frontapp.com/inboxes/shared/intercom/open/latest) - Regular paid/trial support. Usually highest volume.
    * [intercom.io](https://intercom.io) - This is just used for the realtime chat portion of Front, you wont spend much time in it. 
    * [Gitter](https://gitter.im/resin-io/chat) - Our community portal.
    * [Resin Talk](https://talk.resin.io) - our legacy forum which is on its way out.
    * [admin.resin.io](https://admin.resin.io) - make sure you your resin.io account has admin access.
2. Make sure all the accounts you have setup above have a good picture of you and an updated profile.
3. Bookmark and keep open all links in the [Important Links](#important-links) section at the top of this page.
4. Install the resin.io front side panel. You can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/resin-io/hq/wiki/Using-Front#resinio-frontapp-side-bar).
5. Open the Scratch Pad and peruse the content - The scratch pad has a wealth of knowledge of in-the-wild issues, workarounds, canned responses for users, how to do things internally, etc. This is a good place to look for answers before pinging others.
Now you are ready to get stuck in! If you encounter any access restrictions for any of the above, ping the operations guys (Aggelos and Apostolis at the time of writing) or the support lead (Shaun at the time of writing.)
NB!! If you find that you often need to dig into a users device then you should ask Shaun Mulligan if you can get device access and then follow the setup guide for Accessing User Devices.

### Support tools scratchpad

#### Gitter
Has private messaging, but please don't use it (unless it's an emergency), because we can't capture the conversation in a way that lets other folks see what's going on and help.

#### Intercom
If a user complains that they don't see the icon on the website, they may be blocking it. You can ask them to disable the blocker.

#### Zendesk
The heavy-duty helpdesk app we used, though we access it through Front. Please don't respond to users via Zendesk, or we won't capture the content in Front.

#### Front
All roads lead to Front, and those roads break sometimes. Something to be aware of. (We can add more helpful information here as we get it.)


## The Support Week
* **IMPORTANT** - During your 4 hour slot, covering support is your full time and we aim to respond to all questions within 20 minutes or so. If you find reasonable gaps while working on support then by all means work on other tasks, however you should not allow this to interfere with your support duties. Keep a close eye on Front, Zendesk, Gitter and Resin Talk, responding as quickly and as accurately as possible to any new message.
* **IMPORTANT** - always use the resin.io side panel to link tickets in front  to relevant conversations on Flowdock... If someone helps you out with a support ticket, but all their interaction is on flowdock, please ask them to create the link to the flowdock conversation where they contributed. If this is not done the assisting person **will not get any points** unfortunately. 
* You will be assigned support in the Monday call, based on the Support League Table (see above) and will cover support from the end of the meeting until the start of the call on the following Monday, excluding the weekend (see above for details on benefits on offer for weekend cover however!)
* Every day at 2pm GMT the 2 engineers covering the middle 2 slots (i.e.: 11:00 - 19:00) gathers on Mumble with the support lead to discuss currently open tickets and clear up the Front inboxes. Please make sure you are available to attend these meetings so we can discuss conversations you are involved in. If your time zone makes this particularly difficult, let the support lead know and we can make an alternative arrangement.
* Make yourself available for direct notifications in the r/user_happiness Flowdock room and on Front. These should be replied to as quickly as you reasonably can do.
* When you support slot is coming to a close, remember to do a quick and informal handover with the support engineer who is replacing you. Just let him know what tickets are open and want things need attending to.

## Support Workflow
This workflow specifically discusses dealing with support issues in Front, however these steps should be used for resin talk, zendesk and gitter with obvious adjustments - let the support lead know if you are unsure about this.

### Important tips
* We send a bunch of automated messages which users sometimes reply to. Occasionally they are sent as if they are from a member of the team, and are usually pretty obvious. One we send to every user is a hello/welcome message - sometimes users respond talking about what they want to do with resin and more rarely they use it as a thread to report an issue. Regardless it's important to note that we say `We read and reply to every message` here, so every time we get a reply to this message, it's vital to reply to it.
* It's important to avoid being apologetic in general, as we always want to present a positive and confident face to any issue. In some cases it is appropriate to apologise, when it is clear we have failed them and want to make sure they are aware, but this is rare. Generally try to word your messages in a positive way, as while it sounds corny, free support users are potential future customers.
* If we are dealing with a user's issues that has nothing to do with us or the core service, we should be careful to ensure that we communicate (discreetly of course) that rather than us dealing with an issue we are going above and beyond to help them out. It's a subtle distinction but an important one, as the two are separate and it's to make it clear they are receiving a premium service.
* Often a user will only give you a partial UUID or a deviceId, if you need to get the device link, you need to be logged in with your admin account to see their dashboard. In the case that link doesnt take you to the correct device, you can use the search function in the https://admin.resin.io/devices panel. Note that it takes a couple of seconds to filter. You will then need to find the users account name in the list and expand it to see the link to that device.

### When you shift starts
* Check S/support and S/intercom inboxes to see if any new conversations have been started by a user, a user has replied to you or there are new messages from existing conversations with other members of staff which have not been answered yet. Go through and check each open conversation. Its important to look at the `Open` tab and not the `unassigned` tab in the Front inbox.
* If you are not sure about the state of existing conversations with others, ask the support engineer from the previous time slot to fill you in.
* If the conversation is new or a user has replied to you, go ahead and respond, skip to the Replying workflow.
* Otherwise, if a user has replied to an existing conversation with another member of staff and they're around, ping them to deal with it, or step in yourself if you know you can take it over. If they are not around you'll need to make a judgment call - read the conversation and see whether it would make sense for you to jump in and reply.
* If the response is just an ACK, or obviously ending the conversation, or if it is casual and clearly doesn't require an immediately reply then there's no need to respond. However if the user talks about an urgent issue, or it seems appropriate to give a reply (i.e. you can provide this information quickly to them), then by all means do.
* Always let the member of staff who was dealing with the conversation know what's happened.
