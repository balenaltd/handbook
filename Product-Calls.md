## Description
Product calls take place once a week and are led by the product team. It is the time and (virtual) place where we discuss user experience (UX) and feature ideas / questions and come up with implementation plans. Everyone from the resin.io team is welcome to join.

## Using the #product Flowdock tag
If you have a UX or feature question please tag the thread by adding a comment with the `#product` tag and a small summary and, preferably, suggested solution(s). Hubot picks these #product-tagged comments up and sends them to the product FrontApp inbox, which largely forms our next meeting agenda.

`#product` and product-related discussions live in the r-product Flowdock channel.
