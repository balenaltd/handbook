## **Description**

Doughnut calls take place once a week (except on no meetings weeks) on Fridays (or Thursdays late for some) and are attended by an average of 3-5 employees. An internal data puller helps align team members based on timezones to ensure that you get to speak with someone new as much as possible. Invites are usually sent out on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. The goal of these calls is to get to know your co-workers in a fun and relaxed setting. These calls are not mandatory but highly encouraged for you to attend and non-work related conversation is also encouraged. 

If for some reason no-one shows up in the call (possibly due to last minute scheduling conflicts) you are welcome to join another doughnut call thatâ€™s listed on our shared Balena social Google calendar. 

If you know you will be unable to attend one or several of these calls, there is a Doughnut Opt-outs tab within the Team Model Google sheet where you can exclude yourself from these meetings for any period of time. You can find that document [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=1439596851).
