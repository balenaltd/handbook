### What are project-based teams?
We base our teams around the groups who work together to make us successful.
Each team has a Guide role, Dedicated roles and Contributor roles.

The roles assigned here are on a per-project basis, and different people can have different roles on different projects over time.

The Guide is responsible for improving the probability of a positive outcome, or at least making sure its chances of success are clear. Concrete responsibilities include: understanding the overview of the project, maintaining the spec, pushing for removing barriers, asking for more resources when needed, reporting on progress.

The Dedicated people have a specialist role and are key to the project and its progress. Beyond contributing to their focus area, contributors should also make sure to help the guide improve the probability of a positive outcome for the project in general terms.

The Contributor is usually involved in many projects at the same time, acting as a link with their other projects (and the broader context) and making sure everything is going in the same direction. This person is one that has a broader context and can advise on relative priorities, and also opportunities to improve the project scope and approach based on other things theyâ€™re seeing elsewhere.

Every participant of a project team is also responsible with making sure the project as scoped is still the best use of our time and resources and triggering a conversation when they suspect things may be going off track.

Project teams come in two types: projects and pipelines.
* A project needs to have a clear defined goal, something we are actively trying to achieve, and once we do, the project will end.
* A pipeline is for work that continues forever, such as hiring, sales, content publishing, etc. 

Project teams will have a quick check-in call every week. We are trying to group calls according to context and relevance to avoid too much context switching for the balenistas involved in many projects at the same time. 

Ongoing maintenance of core components lives alongside these project teams. For some people, maintenance will be a full time role, while for others, it will be a smaller percentage (and this will fluctuate for different people over time).
