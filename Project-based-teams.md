### What are project-based teams?
We base our teams around the groups who work together to make us successful. Project teams come in two types: **projects** and **pipelines**.

Ideally, a **project** should have:
> * a defined goal that can be accomplished in reasonable time by the people assigned to the project
> * a spec that defines what the goal and milestones are
> * a coordinator who ensures blocks are resolved, issues are raised, and spec is updated
> * specific people with time allocated to work on the project's tasks
> * a project can have advisors/observers who join the check-ins to give their 2c but don't take active tasks

A **pipeline** is for work that continues forever, such as hiring, sales, content publishing, etc. Ideally, a pipeline should have: 
> * a trello-style buffer of well-defined items to review (e.g. device type support, security issues, reliability issues, etc)
> * a coordinator who ensures no tickets are stuck or the appropriate alerts are raised
> * members who take on item-related work
> * can have advisors/observers who join the check-ins to give their 2c but don't take active tasks

### **Different roles**
Each project has an **Owner** role, a **Guide** role, **Dedicated** roles and **Contributor** roles. These roles are assigned on a per-project basis, and different people can have different roles on different projects over time. Each pipeline also has Guide, Dedicated and Contributor roles, but no Owner.

The **Owner** is responsible for improving the probability of a positive outcome or at least making sure its chances of success are clear. Concrete responsibilities include: understanding the overview of the project, maintaining the spec, pushing for removing barriers, asking for more resources when needed, reporting on progress.

The **Guide** is someone senior, usually from the strategy team, giving high-level guidance to make sure the project/pipeline stays aligned with the broader goals of the company.

The **Dedicated** people have a specialist role and are key to the project/pipeline and its progress. Beyond contributing to their focus area, dedicated people should also make sure to help the guide improve the probability of a positive outcome for the project/pipeline in general terms.

The **Contributor** is usually involved in many projects/pipelines at the same time, acting as a link with their other projects (and the broader context) and making sure everything is going in the same direction. This person is one that has a broader context and can advise on relative priorities, and also opportunities to improve the project scope and approach based on other things theyâ€™re seeing elsewhere.

Every participant of a project team is also responsible for making sure the project as scoped is still the best use of our time and resources and triggering a conversation when they suspect things may be going off track.

### **Check-ins**
We are working on improving how we define and review projects, as well as how we schedule the relevant calls. Projects and pipelines will have a check-in call every week. We are trying to group calls according to context, relevance and loops to avoid too much context switching for those involved in many projects at the same time.

Check-ins should review:
> * is anything blocking our progress?
> * do we have any hard questions that should go to a brainstorm?
> * how do we feel about our ability to complete the project/ achieve the pipeline goals with the resources at hand
> * what did we do since last check-in
> * what are the next most important things to work on
> * did we accomplish any big milestones that should
> > * be announced on the all-hands call?
> > * be announced on the mailing list?
> > * are worth a blog post and/or project by the hh team?

At the end of the check-in, the coordinator should think about the following info, to help schedule the check-ins for the next week:
> * did we need someone in the check-in who wasn't invited?
> * did we invite someone in the check-in who wasn't needed?
> * when should the next check-in take place?
> * how much time is needed for this check-in?

Project reviews can be very helpful and we try to review projects on a regular basis. We don't have a standard practice for this at the moment but the below steps are suggested:
> * on a once-a-month basis, a more formal check-in should take place where product/loop leads attend to make sure the project is still progressing and in line with everything else going on.
> * reviews can be longer than regular check-ins (e.g. 90 min) and have s-team join for the last 45 or 60 min.

Ongoing maintenance of core components lives alongside these project teams. For some people, maintenance will be a full-time role, while for others, it will be a smaller percentage (and this will fluctuate for different roles over time).
