### What are project-based teams?
We base our teams around the groups who work together to make us successful.
Each team has a Coordinator role, Contributor roles and a “keeping an eye” role.

The roles assigned here are on a per-project basis, and different people can have different roles on different projects over time.

The Coordinator is responsible for improving the probability of a positive outcome, or at least making sure it’s chances of success are clear. Concrete responsibilities include: understanding the overview of the project, maintaining the spec, pushing for removing barriers, asking for more resources when needed, reporting on progress.

The Contributor has a specialist role on the project. Beyond contributing to their focus area, contributors should also make sure to help the coordinator improve the probability of a positive outcome for the project in general terms.

The “keeping an eye on” person is involved in many projects at the same time, acting as a link with their other projects (and the broader context) and making sure everything is going in the same direction. This person is one that has broader context and can advise on relative priorities, and also opportunities to improve the project scope/approach based on other things they’re seeing elsewhere.

Every participant of a project team is also responsible with making sure the project as scoped is still the best use of our time and resources, and triggering a conversation when they suspect things may be going off track.

Project teams come in three types: milestones, pipeline, and metric-focused.
* Metric-focused teams maintain a mission statement and ongoing progress reports / metrics tracking 
* Pipeline-focused teams work with a segment of the process (e.g. sales, device support, user support).
* Milestone-focused teams maintain a spec which includes a roadmap of what must be done by when.

Ongoing maintenance of core components lives alongside these project teams. For some people, maintenance will be a full time role, for others, it will be a smaller percentage (and this will fluctuate for different people over time)

Project teams will have a quick check-ins on Mondays
* Create project-based update notes -- shared google doc (what used to be the check-in notes and updates in all-hands call).
* Mark the state of the project as green/orange/red
* Updates from project teams will flow into Tuesday call

*This documentation began as [an all-hands presentation when we rolled out project-based teams](https://github.com/resin-io/hq/wiki/All-hands-presentations#thu-feb-15-2018-project-based-teams).*
