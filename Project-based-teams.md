We base our teams around the groups who work together to make us successful.

Each team has a “keeping an eye on” role, a “lead” role, and “team” roles

Three types: product milestones, other milestones, and metric-based teams 
* Milestone-based teams maintain a spec and a roadmap (could be e.g. a Trello board) 
* Metric-based teams maintain a mission statement and ongoing progress reports / metrics tracking 
Ongoing maintenance of core components lives alongside these project teams

For some, maintenance will be a full time role, for others, it will be a smaller percentage (and this will fluctuate for different people over time)

Project teams will have a quick “standups” to check in, on Mondays 
* Create project-based update notes -- shared google doc (what used to be the check-in notes and updates in all-hands call).
* Updates from project teams will flow into Tuesday call
