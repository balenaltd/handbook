We understand that there will be times when you have to deal with unexpected issues, such as illness, family circumstances or bereavement. We offer all team members flexible working hours, and understand if they need to change their normal working hours or take a few hours off if something comes up. For example, if you need to collect your child from school when they’re sick, you need to attend a medical appointment or deal with a situation urgently, etc. we understand that you may need to take a few hours off, and there’s no need to request a sick/emergency leave day. If you’re missing a meeting, or a support shift, it’s important to let the relevant members of the team know you’ll be AFK (away from keyboard) for a few hours.

If that’s not an option, we have a sick & emergency Leave policy in place to help the team out when they need more time away from work due to illness or other personal circumstances. 

This allows you to take time off for these unforeseeable circumstances, and lets you rest and get better if you’re sick, or look after and spend time with family when dealing with a difficult situation. 

We don’t currently have a cap on sick and emergency leave days; we trust the team to use them when they are needed. 

When requesting sick & emergency leave [on Calamari](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Calamari), we request that you leave a comment regarding your absence. This is to let us know what’s going on, how long you might be off, and if there’s anything we can do to help. You can also, however, simply write “sick” or leave blank if you’d prefer not to share. 

If you’re going through a difficult time, are concerned about your ability to work for health reasons, or if you are going to need to be off work for an extended period of time (more than two weeks), you can reach out to a member of teamOS to discuss how best we can accommodate your situation. 

### Conferences, events & training

In case you would like to attend a conference or event during your working hours, our general approach is: 

* if you are attending to speak about or somehow represent balena, then you can do so during your working hours and we will even pay for you to attend
* if you are attending to learn about something related to balena, then you can do so during your working hours but you will have to pay your own way (we advise that this should be no more than 5 days per year)
* if you are attending to learn about something unrelated to balena, then you should take PTO

In case the event takes half or a full day and as we don't have a specific type of leave to request for attending events that are relevant to your work and learning, please make sure you let the team know that you will be out. If unsure, you can discuss with the person who guides your work or ping Alison or Alex regarding the time you need.
