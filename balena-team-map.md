We are a distributed team working from all around the world and we have this [team map](https://www.balena.io/team) to display all the different locations balenistas are based in by adding our logo as a pin for the different cities. We try to keep this as up to date as possible and we need your help to do so! If you don't see our logo at your location, meaning you are the only balenista in that city, you can add your location to the map by filing a new issue with your name and location (city and country) at this [repo](https://github.com/balena-io/resin-site/issues) on Github. If you are not familiar with Github though, take your time to familiarize yourself with how it works and feel free to ask your buddy or any other teammate to support you if you need to.
