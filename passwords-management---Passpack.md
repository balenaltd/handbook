Starting from Day 1, you’ll be required to join a list of services that you’ll be using on a daily basis. Also, depending on your job position and the team that you’ll join, you’ll be given access to additional services. We strongly recommend using a password management service to manage all your passwords and logins. In any case, NEVER keep your passwords in a notebook. NEVER share your, or company’s, passwords with anyone. 

If you don’t know of any password management services to manage all your passwords, take a look and choose from the list below: 

* [Keepass](http://keepass.info/)
* [Lastpass](https://lastpass.com/)
* [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)
* [1Password](https://1password.com/)
* [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org)

Balena is using [Passpack](https://www.passpack.com/online/) to manage passwords centrally and share them with team members when needed. As soon as you need shared log in details to access a service, you will be required to create a Passpack account, using your @balena.io e-mail account and share your nickname with the Operations team. Make sure you sign up for Passpack v7 though (not v8!!) and [activate sharing](https://help.passpack.com/knowledgebase/idx.php/46/107/article/How-to-Activate-Secure-Collaboration-Features.html). You can sign up and follow the instructions [here](https://support.passpack.com/hc/en-us/articles/200730564-How-to-Activate-Secure-Collaboration-Features#passpack7) to activate the secure collaboration feature. You can ask the Operations Team in flow `t/operations` using @@operations and **#access** and they will share any passwords you require to access services through Passpack.
