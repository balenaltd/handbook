Welcome to Flowdock! It’s the nervous system of balena, so using it well is key to integrating with the rest of the team. Some things about it may be counterintuitive, so here is a separate section with some basic tips we have put together to help you get started. There is also a FD [help page](https://www.flowdock.com/help/chat), check the different FD basics sections on the right. 

## Getting bootstrapped
As soon as you accept the email invitation to join Flowdock you’ll be requested to choose your Flowdock username. The first thing you should do when you enter Flowdock for the first time is to replace the nick (chat display name) with your Github handle. <u>Please make sure that your Flowdock username is the same as the one you have in Github</u>. 

One of the best ways to get bootstrapped is to add yourself to all flows and then remove them as you see what you need. You'll get a really good sense of what's going on in the team. It might seem overwhelming as there is a lot of activity and information to follow but you can see which flows you can later "mute" by clicking the 3 dots next to the flow name and which flows are important to you.  

## Chat is Asynchronous, like e-mail
A question on Flowdock is not implied to need immediate response unless explicitly stated. That means if you ask someone something, they may take some time to get back to you as they may be doing something else. It also means that you don’t have to respond immediately to mentions. If you’re taking focus time to do something else, that’s absolutely fine, and indeed encouraged. Otherwise nothing would ever get done.

## Keep conversations in public
A temptation for newcomers is to move conversations to 1-on-1 channels. While those can be comfortable, they can have a number of non-obvious drawbacks. While we won’t ever ban the private conversations, we definitely discourage them, unless the topic of conversation is indeed personal.

For one, a conversation that everyone can’t see is a conversation that everyone can’t contribute to. Many times the right person to answer a question isn’t obvious. 

Secondly, by having the conversation in private, you are then committed to continue it privately, even if it extends beyond the original question. You can’t bring others in, and you get more and more dependent on the specific person you’re speaking to, as only they understand the issue. Communicating the progress of the project and the knowledge gained no longer happens automatically, but is something that you have to do work on. 

Thirdly, there’s the failing part of having a conversation in public. As mentioned above, it’s not bad to fail and you should sometimes expect to fail. Discussing in public and learning to fail in public will help you be transparent and sincere. Public conversations achieve all that automatically. Public conversations are also discoverable by search years later, by someone who may have the same question. Public conversations also allow the rest of the team to know what you’re working on, what you like and don’t like to do, what you’re good at, and in general allows others to adapt to your strengths and weaknesses, and to steer you towards problems you will excel at. Private conversations prevent all of that serendipity from happening, and each of those things has to happen explicitly, and slowly.

## Using threads
Conversation threads is a Flowdock feature that can be a head-scratcher for new users, but an absolute must for everyone else, so make sure you learn how to use them. When looking at a room in flowdock, you may see various colours on the left of a message.

### If you are used to Slack/MatterMost/...

One thing to note if you are used to other chat tools:

FD threads are only for grouping - nobody gets notified when you reply to a thread without @mention'ing them. If you want to notify a thread, check the `@people` section below.

Similarly, nobody gets notified if you post to a flow unless you use `@team`.

![FlowDock Threads screenshot](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/30wuav1RLnUOt1sM6l-ZNhRsP8a_6EU6MmFoyHmkcjcEpCrdfYZ2D42ME09ovCe4m18KkIa2HfToS7Lh0hRfzwR28fXHMlvCd16sYqweY_ZVTMzQU48ZUp6QOPSlrOno_lkxSgbA)

Messages with the same colour, belong to the same thread. If you see many colours, this means there are many conversations going on. By clicking on the bubble, you will see the conversation only. On mobile, you can tap on a message to enter the conversation view. In the conversation view, you can type messages normally, and they will also get the same colour as the rest of the conversation, making clear where they are intended for.

## Re-threading

It can take a little while to get used to how threads work. Don't worry if you accidentally make a new post instead of a reply. To move a post to a thread you can click the re-thread button to the top right of your post or use the colored icons to drag your post on to a thread. This gif by Rich just sums up rethreading!

## Flowdock is best effort
Besides being Async, Flowdock is also best effort. This means that you can’t depend on someone seeing or responding to a message. Messages get lost, notifications get missed. If you wanted an answer to something, don’t be afraid to ping that person again on the same issue.

## Set threads on the right
Threads become much easier if you set them to come up on the right, where the “inbox” view usually is. This is a setting in the Flowdock preferences. Here’s how to do it:

1. Select “preferences” <br>
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/j48kkqCupCrVvv-X6EizZBvzrtFuzrp-i2_eSRik47ajkYzprIOV3f5NTJXEbY_tJivxZ7myqsmt2ucBr9NWtIQBqs_KeKCEE-2khXUBmUpROZwjfuAc_udQk9eVvu8o14QKb_qJ)

1. Select “Layout” <br>

1. Make sure the switch on the right of the option below is green and to the right:

Congratulations! Your threads will now appear on the right!

## Using @team mentions appropriately
Pinging the team can be done by using the @team tag. You can also ping everyone with @everyone. However, it is critical to ensure these tags are used carefully, to avoid notification overload. Only use the @team and @everyone tags if you want every single person in a group to see the message. If you want just one person, but you don’t know who, to see the message, either ping a few people, or ask someone to point you to the right person. An @team will typically notify more than 40 people, so make sure you use them when they are appropriate. Of course, when they are appropriate, have courage and use them proudly! If you need to notify everyone in the group, they are the right tool for the job.

Good: @team we have a new release out, here are the features deployed: (...)

Bad: @team can someone help me with this user? He has a problem with the builder

## Using @person mentions appropriately
The @person tag notifies a person that there is a message for them, sometimes with a desktop notification on their computer, some times with a push notification on their phone, or even both. Use @person notifications when you indeed want that person’s attention, not every time their name is mentioned.

Good: @person can you please look at this bug I found in the UI when you can?

Bad: I saw @person was talking to @person the other day. It gave me an idea about how to change the device OS.

## Using @people mentions correctly 
The @people tag in a thread pings the people involved in the current thread on the current message. @people helps notify all the people included in the specific thread about your message with one tag. Similarly, you can use @t and Hubot will post your message again pinging all the included people in the thread. 

## Adding flows to your account
You may have access to flows which you’re not yet seeing. By pressing the “+” button at the bottom left of your screen, you may discover you have access to flows which you haven’t yet opened. Feel free to join any flow you'd like, even if you're not directly connected to its subject, and contribute to in-flow conversations by sharing your opinion with other team members.

As soon as you join a flow, you’ll get a notification asking you whether you’d like to be part of the team or not. Being part of the team means that you’ll be notified each time someone mentions the team (@team). We suggest being part of the team if you’re interested in the specific room. Note that you can update your choice (opt-in/opt-out) any time you want.

Example rooms:

* t/all - Anything goes. A flow to discuss what people discuss at a pub. Anything! Including some meeting announcements and the occasional all-company announcements.
* t/operations - Anything about business operations of the company including account management, orders, password and access requests and more...
* t/beginners - A flow to ask any beginner's questions, reach out to your balena buddy and others that can help you with those, ask questions you have related to balena or other tech and more... 
* i/supervisor - Talk about our agent that runs on the device
* i/devices - Yocto, device OS conversations
 

Some room name prefixes (r/, i/...) align the rooms with stages of a process:  
  (s)ensing => (r)easoning => (i)mplementation => (d)eployment => (e)nvironment  
Other prefixes mean (f)ramework, (p)rojects and (t)eam.

Note that we create other rooms from time to time that are project-specific or related to a specific activity. If you're in one of those, you'll know what they're for.

## hashtags
Flowdock supports #hashtags and we find it very useful to use them when we don’t want anything important to get lost into the sea of conversations. That’s why we use specific hashtags into our messages in order to be able to talk about it at the appropriate meeting. When one of the following hashtags are typed into a message, an email is sent to a specific address which can be seen in one of Front’s inboxes. Then an agenda can be collated for the relevant meeting, such as architecture (#arch) or teamOS (#teamos) brainstorm calls, or and action can be taken, such as Operations team giving you access to a service (#access) or placing an order (#order). Once you type your message using one of the hashtag, Hubot will generate a message confirming that your message has been sent. Note that if you forget to add the hashtag and you edit to add it, your message will not be sent. The hashtags should be used in the original message to generate an email to the relevant inbox. 

Some examples are:
* #access => access
* #ama, askalex, ask => ama
* #arch, architecture => architecture
* #blog, writeup, toblogfor => blog
* #bots, botfail, bottest => bots
* #commercial, disco, ringthebell => commercial
* #cust-arch, custard => cust-arch
* #design => design
* #devices => devices
* #devops, deploy => devops
* #devprocess, dev-process, dev-tools, devtools => devops+process
* #docs => docs
* #fleet, deviceupdate, device-update, fleetops => fleet
* #hardware => hardware
* #incident, reliability => reliability
* #meeting-notes, meeting, meetingnotes, minutes => team+minutes
* #newsletter => newsletter
* #operations => operations
* #outreach, marketing, mention => outreach
* #order, orders => orders
* #process, processfail => process
* #product => product
* #projects, project => projects
* #release-notes => team+release
* #rename => rename
* #security => security
* #team => team
* #fin-roadmap => productfin
* #legal, finance => finance
* #subscription => subscription
* #balenalabs => balenalabs
* #CompanyOSProduct => companyos-product
* #CompanyOSArchitecture => companyos-architecture
* #teamos => teamOS

As we actively build on the list of hashtags we use, there are many more, so feel free to ask [Hubot](https://github.com/balena-io/hubot-as-mainbot) which hashtags are used at the specific flow you are interested in by typing: `Hubot, show me your hashtags`. Remember that Hubot needs to be added to the flow for the hashtags to work! 

Please keep in mind that the message that contains the hashtag should have all the info required and be more than four words. Sterile hashtags with up-arrows won’t work. Also, any later edit will not be sent, so make sure your message sent contains all the required info, or create a new one if you need to correct it. 

Some examples of using hashtags and the message that Hubot sends:

## Your first message
Now that you are an expert on Flowdock :) it's time for your first meeting with the team. You'll be introduced in the public flow by the balenista assisting with your onboarding.

Following the customary greetings, it would be great if you took the time to create and send a brief intro of yourself as your first task. You may include any details you wish about yourself, family, work, interests or anything else you deem appropriate.

## Changing the look and feel
Papagal is a Chrome and Firefox extension that improves user experience while using Flowdock. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/petrosagg/papagal). Unfortunately, the Firefox addon has been taken down for now.
