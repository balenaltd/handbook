As you will hear from other teammates, it does take some time until you get used to it, especially if this is your first experience of being part of a remote team based across different timezones. As balenistas are based all over the world, the communication flows around the clock, so you can be getting pings anytime. However, asynchronous working should allow everyone to focus on tasks when needed without worrying about responding to pings as they come in. It always helps to communicate what you are working on among your teammates, so between smaller teams, there is a better workflow for everyone. We often see tasks being blocked while waiting for a teammate to take action (e.g. reviewing PRs) and this can become a pattern when people in opposite timezones are working together. Thus, prioritizing tasks that can unblock other balenistas when possible, is highly appreciated.
