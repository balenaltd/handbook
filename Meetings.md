You are free to join all calls (we try to keep some calls that might include sensitive information in smaller groups) but it’s not mandatory if you don’t belong to the specific team. Please note that all calls are included in the Balena Admin shared calendar. In addition, bear in mind that the Balena Admin calendar follows GMT (UTC +0) London time zone.

While there are some calls that have been regular and standard for a long time, we always make sure we have a dynamic schedule in place to meet our needs, the projects and ideas we are working on at the time. Below are some key calls we use and you can check the Balena Admin calendar for more. We are currently investing more time in the LoopMVP project so you will see the relevant calls scheduled and you can read more at the `Work in Progress section`. 

## Company Call - All-hands
This is the call where all balenistas join once per week and get notified of the most important things that occurred last week and plans for the next week. The agenda has sections completed by different teams, so different teammates take turns to present the different parts every week. It’s mandatory for everyone to be there and it’s usually held on Mondays. There is an Atlantic slot, followed by a Pacific one to make sure all balenistas in different timezones can join this call and have the opportunity to ask questions. You will find the agenda attached to the calendar invite and the link is shared with everyone in the morning as well. Chaired by @shaunmulligan

These are company wide presentations that all balenistas are encouraged to attend. Sometimes these would be about core company ideas and progress, while we are trying to have more balenistas to get involved and use this platform to share knowledge, learning, interesting topics, and concepts, as well as connect more.
