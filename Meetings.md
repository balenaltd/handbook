The Balena Admin calendar contains all our company calls. Make sure it's added to your Google Calendar list (calendar ID `admin@balena.io`). In addition, bear in mind that the Balena Admin calendar follows London time, which is GMT+1 during British Summer Time (Daylight Saving Time), and GMT otherwise. You are free to join any calls (we do try to keep some calls that might include sensitive information in smaller groups and if that is the case, someone on the call will let you know) but it’s not mandatory if you don’t belong to the specific project team. Joining a few different calls when you are new is a good way to familiarise with different projects and process and get an idea of how different type of calls are facilitated and flow. Feel free to participate and ask questions too! 

We have the following fixed-time meetings on Balena Admin calendar, recurring week-to-week:
* all-hands calls; this is our weekly company wide call
* brainstorms, including per-loop architecture calls and product calls

Then, we also have checkin calls that are dynamically scheduled from week to week. These focus on tracking the progress and updates on individual projects and pipelines. You can check the [Current Projects tab of the Team Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=110615447) for all the project and pipeline related calls and the [Other Calls tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=180453935) for all the brainstorms, company wide and other calls. Not all, but some calendar invites or Team Model entries will also have a spec or relevant document to give you more information about the call. If you want to know more about meetings are scheduled and the balena meeting scheduler, you can read more [here](https://github.com/balena-io/meeting-scheduler).

We use brainstorm calls to discuss new ideas, issues and solutions. For more guidance on how we run brainstorm calls, check out this [work in progress guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHb-D2vJxufa8OZPU55V5WBIXuQ44MNL4fcXw52lEe8/edit#). 

We have one no-scheduled-meetings-week every month to allow more time for everyone to focus on their work. These weeks will only have the company-wide, all-hands call scheduled as normal. 

We are currently investing more time in the LoopMVP project so you will see the relevant calls scheduled and you can read more at the `Work in Progress section` in this Wiki. Read the relevant [PSA: Loop Days on Balena Admin calendar](https://www.flowdock.com/app/rulemotion/t-process/threads/8tOMC_buNSF3m-MkIamCubpp-Zg) for some information about how calls are grouped by loop in order to reduce context switching and allow balenistas to group their calls in fewer days. Also, please note how you can help by allowing more flexibility on your working hours for the days your calls are scheduled if you are able to do so. Just a reminder that `loops` is an approach and system we have been working on for a while and you can get an introduction and more information by watching the relevant summit recordings or watch [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xHaZredpmAN5Ewb8lro6LovkVLVjIDJE/view) to get an overview. As with everything at balena, the best way to get more context and understanding is by asking questions and talking to your teammates! 

## Adding yourself to (or removing yourself from) Balena Admin calendar events

We all have write/edit access to this calendar. Please use it carefully! 

**What to do:**
* Check the fixed-time-meetings, and add yourself as a guest to all events that you will attend. If you'll attend a meeting every week (or need to keep the option open to attend), select the `This and following events` option.
* Also, if you are on the guest list of meetings that you do not / will not attend, please remove yourself from these.

**The goal:**
* Making sure everyone's calendars reflect their meeting attendance as closely as possible.
* Eliminating the occurrence where you create new events on your personal calendar as reminders to attend Admin calendar events, since they fall out of sync when the Admin calendar is updated.

**What NOT to do:**
* Please do not ever remove events from the Balena Admin calendar.
* Please do not add new events to the Balena Admin calendar.

## What if I want to "observe" on checkins?

Project and pipeline checkins are scheduled dynamically from week to week, around the fixed-time meetings, and active participants receive invites automatically.

However, our project & pipeline definitions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=110615447) do not allow for "observer membership". This is because:
* The checkin scheduler is highly constrained already, so piling on constraints for people who don't really need to be there is not practical.
* We want to avoid sending invites week after week to people who don't really need to attend, creating a situation where they passively attend "just because it's on their calendar".

BUT of course, there are many of you who are interested in "observing" the progress on projects/pipelines you're not actively working on. 

**What to do:**
* Confirm with the project owner/pipeline guide that you're welcome to attend.
* Check the Balena Admin calendar for the next checkin, and add yourself as a guest. If it's at a time that you cannot attend, you'll have to catch up async.
* Note that this invite is not preserved for next checkin rounds, you'll need to re-add yourself if you want to attend another.

## Meeting recordings
There are many meetings that are always recorded and available for those who are not able to attend in real-time and/or want to re-visit for finer information. These include but are not limited to company-wide calls and calls such as architecture and product calls. You will most probably find the link to the recording and any notes if you click on the calendar invite. If the call is using GoogleMeet and it is recorded, the recording will automatically attach to the invite after the call ends. You can use this recording function for any of your calls if you find it useful. If the call is using Zoom (e.g. all-hands call), then there will be a link where you can find all the recordings.
