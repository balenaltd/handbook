The Balena Admin calendar contains all our company calls. Make sure it's added to your Google Calendar list (calendar ID admin@balena.io). In addition, bear in mind that the Balena Admin calendar follows GMT (UTC +0) London time zone. You are free to join any calls (we do try to keep some calls that might include sensitive information in smaller groups) but it’s not mandatory if you don’t belong to the specific project team.

While there are some calls that have been regular and standard for a long time, we always make sure we have a dynamic schedule in place to meet our needs, as well as the projects and ideas we are working on at the time. Below are some key calls we use and you can check the Balena Admin calendar for more. We use brainstorm calls to discuss new ideas, issues, and solutions, while checkin calls focus on tracking progress and updates and these are set up per project/ pipeline. We have a no-scheduled-meetings-week every month to allow more time for everyone to focus on their work. These weeks will only have the company-wide, all-hands call scheduled as normal. 

We have the following fixed-time meetings on Balena Admin calendar, recurring week-to-week:
* all-hands calls
* brainstorms
* product calls
* arch calls

### Adding yourself to (or removing yourself from) Balena Admin calendar events

You all have write access to this calendar. Please use it carefully! 

**What to do:**
* Check the fixed-time-meetings, and add yourself as a guest to all events that you will attend. If you'll attend a meeting every week (or need to keep the option open to attend), select the `This and following events` option.
* Also, if you are on the guest list of meetings that you do not / will not attend, please remove yourself from these.

**The goal:**
* Making sure everyone's calendars reflect their meeting attendance as closely as possible.
* Eliminating the occurrence where you create new events on your personal calendar as reminders to attend Admin calendar events, since they fall out of sync when the Admin calendar is updated.

**What NOT to do:**
* Please do not ever remove events from the Balena Admin calendar.
* Please do not add new events to the Balena Admin calendar.

### What if I want to "observe" on checkins?

Project/pipeline checkins are scheduled dynamically from week to week, around the fixed-time meetings, and active participants receive invites automatically.

However, our project/pipeline definitions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=110615447) do not allow for "observer membership". This is because:
* The checkin scheduler is highly constrained already, so piling on constraints for people who don't really need to be there is not practical.
* We want to avoid sending invites week after week to people who don't really need to attend, creating a situation where they passively attend "just because it's on their calendar".

BUT of course, there are many of you who are interested in "observing" the progress on projects/pipelines you're not actively working on. 

**What to do:**
* Confirm with the project owner/pipeline guide that you're welcome to attend.
* Check the Balena Admin calendar for the next checkin, and add yourself as a guest. If it's at a time that you cannot attend, you'll have to catch up async.
* Note that this invite is not preserved for next checkin rounds, you'll need to re-add yourself if you want to attend another.

While there are some calls that have been regular and standard for a long time, we always make sure we have a dynamic schedule in place to meet our needs, as well as the projects and ideas we are working on at the time. Check current projects [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=110615447) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=180453935). We use brainstorm calls to discuss new ideas, issues and solutions, while checkin calls focus on tracking the progress and updates, so these calls are set up for specific projects and/or pipelines. We have a no-scheduled-meetings-week every month to allow more time for everyone to focus on their work. These weeks will only have the company-wide, all-hands call scheduled as normal. 

We are currently investing more time in the LoopMVP project so you will see the relevant calls scheduled and you can read more at the `Work in Progress section` in this Wiki. Read the relevant [PSA: Loop Days on Balena Admin calendar](https://www.flowdock.com/app/rulemotion/t-process/threads/8tOMC_buNSF3m-MkIamCubpp-Zg) for some information about how calls are grouped by loop in order to reduce context switching and allow balenistas to group their calls in fewer days. Also, please note how you can help by allowing more flexibility on your working hours for the days your calls are scheduled if you are able to do so. 

## Company Call - All-hands
This is the call where all balenistas join once per week and get notified of the most important things that occurred last week and plans for the next week. The agenda has sections completed by different teams, so different teammates take turns to present the different parts every week. It’s mandatory for everyone to be there and it’s usually held on Mondays. There is an Atlantic slot, followed by a Pacific one to make sure all balenistas in different timezones can join this call and have the opportunity to ask questions. You will find the agenda attached to the calendar invite and the link is shared with everyone in the morning as well. Chaired by @shaunmulligan

## All hands presentation
These are company wide presentations that all balenistas are encouraged to attend. Sometimes these would be about core company ideas and progress, while we are trying to have more balenistas to get involved and use this platform to share knowledge, learning, interesting topics, and concepts, as well as connect more. 

## Architecture Calls
This call is about the architectural stuff of balena. Led by @petrosagg
