“Summit” is what we call our annual face to face team meeting. It’s one of the highlights in the balena calendar year. This is the time of the year that all balenistas get together in one place and spend one week aligning on our vision, brainstorming, hacking, getting to know each other better, reflecting on the past year, and shaping the company’s roadmap and future.  

We have run a few summits over the years. Since the beginning of 2019, and especially after completing our Series B funding round in July 2019 we've been focusing on growing our globally distributed team. The strength of our team is never more apparent than at our annual week-long summit. Check this [blog post](https://www.balena.io/blog/summit-2019-barcelona-thats-a-wrap/) about summit 2019 which too place in Barcelona, Spain for the second time. 

### Summit 2020
Summit 2020 ended up looking quite a bit different than we had originally planned and as such, it ended up being our first-ever virtual summit! Check this blog post for more info on how we ran our virtual summit 2020.

### Vision Week 2021
Six months after our virtual annual summit in September 2020, we held what we called a Vision Week, or a sort of virtual mini-summit. It was a chance for us to catch up on what we’re building, why we’re building it, and how we’ll build it, without waiting a full year between summits. The goal was to refresh and converge on our vision and priorities for the upcoming year and beyond. It was a good opportunity to zoom out and add important context and perspective to help guide our work.


We strongly encourage every new balenista to spend some time watching past summit recordings to better understand our vision, our current areas of focus, as well as how we work together at balena. These will give you a lot of context and help you understand balena better. You can chat with your buddy to get some help around which recordings might more relevant to you and your area of work.
