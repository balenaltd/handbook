“Summit” is what we call the annual face to face team meeting. It’s one of the greatest events of a calendar year for the company. This is the time of the year that all team members get together in one place and spend at least one week together, hacking, brainstorming, getting to know each other better and shaping the company’s roadmap and future in general. 

It's very very interesting to see diverse cultures come together, and it's actually eye-opening how easily people connect and make these events the most memorable moment of the year.
