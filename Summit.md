“Summit” is what we call our annual face to face team meeting. It’s one of the greatest events of a calendar year for balena. This is the time of the year that all balenistas get together in one place and spend one week together aligning on our vision, hacking, brainstorming, getting to know each other better, reflecting on the past year, and shaping the company’s roadmap and future.  

We strongly encourage every new balenista to spend some time to watch past summit recordings to better understand our vision, as well as how we work at balena. These will give you a lot of context and help you understand balena better.
