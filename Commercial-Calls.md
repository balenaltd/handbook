## Description
Commercial calls take place once a week and are led by the commercial team. It is the time and (virtual) place where we discuss sales/customer success team process, pricing plans, and commercial strategy. Everyone from the resin.io team is welcome to join.

## Using the #commercial Flowdock tag
If you have a commercial topic for discussion (for example, an idea about our pricing plans, or a question about how to approach structuring a particular deal, or an idea for the sales/customer success team process), please tag the thread by adding a comment with the `#commercial` tag and a small summary and, preferably, suggested solution(s). Hubot picks these #commercial-tagged comments up and sends them to the commercial inbox in Front, which forms our next meeting agenda.

`#commercial` and commercial-related discussions live in the r-commercial Flowdock channel (they also sometimes arise from s/sales-meta)
