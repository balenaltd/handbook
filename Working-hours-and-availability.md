Team working is important, especially in remote teams where the majority of the people work from different places and in different timezones. That’s probably one of the challenges when choosing to be a remote-first company. On the other hand, different timezones benefit the team in terms of the support we provide our users with, the response time to support requests and the availability of the team to respond to users at any time of the day. In general, we don’t ask people to work on a specific time schedule. Each one can work the hours they prefer as long as this is communicated as described in the section below, their schedule is not changing every day, the work gets done and they are reachable. 

We are always looking at ways to improve the experience of remote and asynchronous working at balena. As you will hear from other teammates, it does take some time until you get used to it, especially if this is your first experience of being part of a remote team based across different timezones. As balenistas are based all over the world, the communication flows around the clock, so you can be getting pings anytime. However, asynchronous working should allow everyone to focus on tasks when needed without worrying about responding to pings as they come in. It always helps to communicate what you are working on among your teammates, so between smaller teams, there is a better workflow for everyone. We often see tasks being blocked while waiting for a teammate to take action (eg. reviewing PRs) and this can become a pattern when people in opposite timezones are working together. Thus, prioritizing tasks that can unblock other balenistas when possible, is highly appreciated. It takes some time and team effort to find the right balance for work to run smoothly for everyone, so invest that time to discuss with your teammates if needed. 

The 9am to 6pm period for working from the office is pretty common. If you choose to work from home, be careful not to abuse or ruin your work routine. Working from home should be treated as a productivity boost and as a flexibility offered to help achieve a better balance between personal and professional life. 


### Communicating your availability

It is important to communicate your working hours to the rest of the team, since

* scheduling algorithms are used to schedule events at times that are as convenient as possible for everyone, and therefore need your preferred hours as input, and
* your team members need to know when you will be available.

For these purposes, team members indicate their working hours in the [Team Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=404458414) Google Sheet.

You should be reachable on Flowdock during your stated working hours but if this changes, you can let the team know with a quick message. This is critical in order to keep our workflow running and help all balenistas deliver on time without any interruption. No need to let anyone know if you are popping out for a while, just for any major unexpected disruptions during your day that might affect others! You can use the r/team FD flow to ping the team for this or any other flow in case you want to let a smaller group of people you are working with know who might be affected by your unexpected absence.


#### How to enter your working hours

Your preferred working hours for Monday through Friday are set in a Team Model tab titled by your Github handle. The `Working hours` column in the [Current Team](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=404458414) tab contains a link to your personal tab, or you can find it by scrolling through the tabs at the bottom of the page. Each day is divided into 48 half-hour slots. The column headings indicate the start time of each hour. When you join, some example values have already been filled in for you. Please note that this is for illustration only, and does not indicate an expectation of when exactly you should work. Customize as needed.

Fill all the slots representing your normal working hours with 1s (indicating available, preferred). If there are additional slots when you are willing to work (i.e. attend a meeting, or do support if you are a support agent), provided that (a) it is really necessary and (b) there will be prior notice for such an appointment, fill these with 2s (indicating available, but non-preferred). This is sometimes necessary if you have to meet with team members from very different time zones. 

Finding sufficient overlap between the team's availabilities is an ongoing challenge. The checkin scheduler can sometimes only find a solution by pushing a few people a week outside their hours, and then we reschedule ad hoc if this doesn't work. To help us find a better solution, we're adding another level of resolution to how you specify your working hours: the digit 3. So fill with 3s any slots that you would really prefer not be scheduled, but can potentially make it if (a) there's absolutely no other option, (b) you are pre-scheduled and pinged about this, and (c) you reserve the option to ack or decline on a case-to-case basis. (Obviously, you are considered afk if not pre-scheduled.) See the relevant [PSA](https://www.flowdock.com/app/rulemotion/t-process/threads/__s09UzVZMrkhd4nC7mY4W-5E9O) with an example. 

When you join, your usual time zone is recorded for you in [Default Time Zones](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=2094979175) and is taken into account automatically. You therefore only need to consider your local clock when filling in your preferences.


#### Time zone overrides for travelling

If you travel to another location and will be working from there, an override needs to be entered in [Time Zone Overrides](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=890329460). If your travel is booked by balena's operations team, they will create the entry for you, but if not, please make a one-line entry with the relevant time zone.


#### Calamari and Google Calendar events

For the purpose of scheduling a new event, your working hours alone are not enough. The scheduler also needs to know:

- whether you are on leave (as recorded in the Calamari leave management software)
- what other events you already have scheduled during those working hours ("busy" events as contained in your balena Google Calendar)

Therefore, to get your actual availability for scheduling, functions run in the background once a day to read everyone's working hours, import overriding events from Calamari and Google Calendar, and write the whole team's aligned availabilities until the end of the next week to a sheet named [UK Time Team Availabilities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=1035327337). This sheet is crucial for the scheduling algorithms, but can also be useful for you to check when other team members will be available.


#### Remember to keep your preferences updated!

Please make sure that your preference sheet in the Team Model and your balena Google Calendar are always up to date (ideally 2 weeks in advance), to ensure that the scheduling algorithms can do their job well! Hubot will also remind us from time to time to update working hours :)

In the event of an unexpected last-minute change to your regular working hours (for example due to a family emergency or other eventuality), you can just ping the team on Flowdock to inform them when you will be reachable again.


### What is a good place to work from?

Below you can see from our experience over the years what we consider a good place to work from. 
- enough equipment around you to perform any work duties you have, and enough space to use them
- reliable internet connection, enough for video
- a quiet place to take calls from
- a working environment that doesn't compromise your productivity and gives you long stretches of distraction-free time to work
- a fixed address where the Operations team can send you parcels if needed
- advance notice and approval when it comes to shifting timezones and working days significantly.
- ability to meet all your standard obligations like team check-ins, all-hands calls, applicable brainstorms, etc
