Co-working is important, especially in remote teams where the majority of the people in a team work from different places and in different timezones. And that’s probably one of the tradeoffs for choosing to be a company that supports remote working. On the other hand, different timezones benefit the team in terms of the support we provide our users with, the response time to support requests and the availability of the team to respond to users at any time of the day. In general, we don’t push people to work on a specific time schedule. Each one can work the hours he/she prefers as long as this is communicated as described in the section below, his/her schedule is not changing every day, the work gets done and he/she is reachable.

The 9am to 6pm period for working from the office is pretty common. If you choose to work from home, be careful not to abuse or ruin your work routine. Working from home should be treated as a productivity boost and as a flexibility offered to help achieve a better balance between personal and professional life.

You should be reachable by instant messaging (or by mobile) at any time during your working hours. This is critical in order to keep our workflow running and help all team members deliver on time without any interruption.

### Communicating your availability

It is important to communicate your working hours to the rest of the team, since

scheduling algorithms are used to schedule events at times that are as convenient as possible for everyone, and therefore need your preferred hours as input, and
your team members need to know when you will be available.
For these purposes, team members indicate their working hours in the Team Model Google Sheet.

#### How to enter your working hours

Your preferred working hours for Monday through Friday are set in a sheet titled by your Github handle (in the Team Model Google Sheet). Each day is divided into 48 half-hour slots. The column headings indicate the start time of each hour. When you join, some example values have already been filled in for you. Please note that this is for illustration only, and does not indicate an expectation of when exactly you should work. Customize as needed.

Fill all the slots representing your normal working hours with 1s (indicating available, preferred). If there are additional slots when you are willing to work (i.e. attend a meeting, or do support if you are a support agent), provided that (a) it is really necessary and (b) there will be prior notice for such an appointment, fill these with 2s (indicating available, but non-preferred). This is sometimes necessary if you have to meet with team members from very different time zones. Leave open all slots where you are not available at all.

When you join, your usual time zone is recorded for you in Default Time Zones and is taken into account automatically. You therefore only need to consider your local clock when filling in your preferences.

#### Time zone overrides for travelling

If you travel to another location and will be working from there, an override needs to be entered in Time Zone Overrides. If your travel is booked by balena's operations team, they will create the entry for you, but if not, please make a one-line entry here with the relevant time zone.

#### Calamari and Google Calendar events

For the purpose of scheduling a new event, your working hours alone are not enough. The scheduler also needs to know:

- whether you are on leave (as recorded in the Calamari leave management software)
- what other events you already have scheduled during those working hours ("busy" events as contained in your balena Google Calendar)

Therefore, to get your actual availability for scheduling, functions run in the background once a day to read everyone's working hours, import overriding events from Calamari and Google Calendar, and write the whole team's aligned availabilities until the end of the next week to a sheet named UK Time General Preferences. This sheet is crucial for the scheduling algorithms, but can also be useful for you to check when other team members will be available.

#### Remember to keep your preferences updated!

Please make sure that your preference sheet in the Team Model and your balena Google Calendar are always up to date (ideally 2 weeks in advance), to ensure that the scheduling algorithms can do their job well!

In the event of an unexpected last-minute change to your regular working hours (for example due to a family emergency or other eventuality), you can just ping the team on Flowdock to inform them when you will be reachable again.

### What is a good place to work from?

Below you can see from our experience over the years what we consider a good place to work from. 
- enough equipment around you to perform any work duties you have, and enough space to use them in
- reliable internet connection, enough for video
- a quiet place to take calls from
- a working environment that doesn't compromise your productivity and gives you long stretches of distraction-free time to work
- a fixed address where the ops team can send you parcels if needed
- advance notice and approval when it comes to shifting timezones and working days significantly.
- ability to meet all your standard obligations like team check-ins, all-hands calls, applicable brainstorms, etc
