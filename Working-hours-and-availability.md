Co-working is important, especially in remote teams where the majority of the people in a team work from different places and in different timezones. And that’s probably one of the tradeoffs for choosing to be a company that supports remote working. On the other hand, different timezones benefit the team in terms of the support we provide our users with, the response time to support requests and the availability of the team to respond to users at any time of the day. In general, we don’t push people to work on a specific time schedule. Each one can work on the hours he/she prefers as long as the team knows about it (inform the team in Flowdock), his/her schedule is not changing every day, the work gets done and he/she is reachable.

The 9am to 6pm period for working from the office is pretty common. If you choose to work from home, be careful not to abuse or ruin your work routine. Working from home should be treated as a productivity boost and as a flexibility offered to help achieve a better balance between personal and professional life.

You should be reachable by instant messaging (or by mobile) at any time during your working hours. This is critical in order to keep our workflow running and help all team members deliver on time without any interruption.

### What is a good place to work from?

Below you can see from our experience over the years what we consider a good place to work from. 
- enough equipment around you to perform any work duties you have, and enough space to use them in
- reliable internet connection, enough for video
- quiet place to take calls from
- a working environment that doesn't compromise your productivity and gives you long stretches of distraction-free time to work
- a fixed address where the ops team can send you parcels if needed
- advance notice and approval when it comes to shifting timezones and working days significantly.
- ability to meet all your standard obligations like team checkins, all hands calls, applicable brainstorms, etc
