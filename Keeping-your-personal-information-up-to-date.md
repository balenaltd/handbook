### Personal information
For every new starter, we create an entry on the [Team Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=404458414) with some key personal information that are available to the team, including your location. We also keep the more sensitive information, such as addresses, emergency contacts and contact numbers on a separate confidential folder. 

### Changing your personal information
It is important that you let someone from the Operations or TeamOS team know if you change any of the below:
* your name
* location
* address
* contact number & email
* emergency contact.

This is so we can keep our records up to date and make other relevant changes when needed. For example, a change of name or country might mean that we need to issue a new contract for you. We also rely on our records for orders and deliveries to team members, as well as for maintaining our [team map](https://www.balena.io/team) with pins for all ballenistas' locations which we would like to keep tidy and updated.
