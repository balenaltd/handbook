### Personal information
For every new starter, we create an entry on the [Team Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit#gid=404458414) with some key personal information that are available to the team, including your location. We also keep the more sensitive information, such as addresses, emergency contacts and contact numbers on a separate confidential folder. 

### Birthday public or private view
Every week during the [All Hands call](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/All-hands-calls) document we wish happy birthday to team members. We do understand though that everyone's birth date is private info that not everyone might  want to share with the whole team at a call. For that reason, we have made it possible for every team member to change that at their [personal working hours and availability sheet](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-io/wiki/Working-hours-and-availability) in the [Team model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m1Ln8lfcMaUngbEsaQdbz1Dtts4e8HBj9XsMqBwTeXM/edit?usp=sharing)at any given time.

### Changing your personal information
It is important that you let someone from the Operations or TeamOS team know if you change any of the below:
* your name
* location
* address
* contact number & email
* emergency contact.

This is so we can keep our records up to date and make other relevant changes when needed. For example, a change of name or country might mean that we need to issue a new contract for you. We also rely on our records for orders and deliveries to team members, as well as for maintaining our [team map](https://www.balena.io/team) with pins for all ballenistas' locations which we would like to keep tidy and updated.
