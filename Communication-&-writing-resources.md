### Resources that can help you communicate at balena
As a distributed team, much of our communication happens in written form, with some higher bandwidth discussions over call/video as well. It's extremely important that we all communicate clearly with one another, and work on honing our writing and speaking skills. The team has started a list of resources that might be helpful if you're looking for ways to improve those skills. Contributions are welcome! 

* [Politics and the English Language](https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit)
* [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk-ebook/dp/B07NPN5HTP)
* [Economical Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Economical-Writing-Third-Thirty-Five-Persuasive-ebook/dp/B07RRH2XS4)
* [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
* [How To Disagree](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html)

We are committed to improving the way we communicate and work together, especially due to the remote and asynchronous related challenges we often face. While we are building our team directory which will be providing useful information for every balenista, [Alexandros](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6MdRhbCgtcsiPJMA_RaXUzPRvfmw6JIPW-sVs-GGik/edit#heading=h.gt122jwf665r) and [Alison](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qXAXjT8MqUETQGRYLh50tCgs-avFQB-_nIJ8PwkU2vY/edit) have put together a `user's manual` and encourage everyone to put together their own to share with the team. It can offer great insight into who you are, how you work, and allow others to get some background and context around your approach and style of working.
