Part of your daily routine may include meetings with other team members, the team that you’re part of, clients and more. Also, you will often be required to start a meeting and invite some of your colleagues. You should always check your calendar and other team members’ calendar before inviting someone to a call or before scheduling a new call, to make sure it doesn’t overlap with other important calls. 

Before we proceed, please make sure that you have access to the company calendar; Balena Admin calendar (ownership of admin@balena.io). Please note that all calls are included in the Balena Admin calendar. In addition, bear in mind that the admin calendar follows GMT (UTC +0) London time zone.

## See a colleague’s calendar
Let’s say you need to schedule a call where one of your colleagues need to be invited but you’re not sure whether they have any open slots. One solution would be to ask them directly about availability. This would mean that you both will need to stop what you’re doing and work on scheduling that call.

Google calendar has a feature which allows you to add a coworker’s calendar to your calendar. Let’s see how you can do that:

1. Log in to your @balena.io e-mail account and go to calendar.google.com
1. At the "Add a coworkers's calendar" field, write the name or the @balena.io e-mail address of the coworker whose calendar you want to see and click on it
1. Coworker’s calendar entries will show up in your calendar

Hint: if you’re a Mac user, you’ll find the following link really useful, https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect.

## Add an event to your calendar
In balena, we try to keep our company events open for all team members. Anyone can join any meeting they would like to, as long as that’s a company meeting. How would you know if an event is a company/event or open to everyone? The answer is that it’ll be on the company calendar (admin@balena.io) which you can access already. 

So, let’s say you’d like to add a repeating event to your calendar and get reminders about it. The best way to do this is to:

1. Log in to your @balena.io e-mail account and go to calendar.google.com
1. Click on the event title that you’re interested in, or click on the coloured space next to event’s title. (note: make sure that you've clicked on the original event and not on the event someone added/copied to their calendar)

3. Go to the Options choice (the 3 dots on the upper right) and select the calendar you wish to include the event to.

From now on, you will receive notifications and reminder with regards to this event.

## Booking a Zoom room in Google Calendar

Since all scheduled meetings, presentations and discussions are mainly done remotely, it is important to provide a video and audio communication platform where team members can participate. We do this by booking a Zoom room in Google Calendar while creating an event or a meeting.

Please check out the following steps to include a zoom room when creating an event:

1. When creating an event, click on the “ROOMS” tab next to the “GUESTS” tab.

2. Click on “Available rooms only”, to see which rooms are available. 

3. Then you will see a list of available rooms. If there aren’t any rooms available, there won’t be any options.

4. Click on an available room.

5. When you’re done creating the event, Google Calendar will share a Zoom URL.

6. If there aren't any rooms available, just type in flowdock "get a zoom" and Hubot will provide an available room. (Note: The room which Hubot will provide is the room available only at that specific moment. Hubot cannot book a room in advance)
