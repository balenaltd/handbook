Part of your daily routine may include meetings with other team members, the team that you’re part of, clients and more. Also, you will often be required to start a meeting and invite some of your colleagues. You should always check your calendar and other team members’ calendar before inviting someone to a call or before scheduling a new call, to make sure it doesn’t overlap with other important calls. 

Before we proceed, please make sure that you have access to the company calendar; [Balena Admin calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=admin%40balena.io&ctz=Europe%2FAthens) (ownership of admin@balena.io), [Balena Social Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=balena.io_alenh700u1kual2pk9j5n4ujdk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FAthens), [Calamari Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=resin.io_6hoecbna6i1e75mft25tqop1uo%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FAthens) and if applicable to you, the [Support calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=resin.io_2klk2f26ivo04qq5ktlkva1neg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FAthens). Each calendar has a plus icon on the bottom right, allowing you to add it to your individual calendar.

After you have been onboarded, if you noticed you do not have access to any of the following calendars you can request access in the Operations channel in Flowdock (by using #access with the name of the calendar you'd like to be given access to). Please note that all calls are included in the Balena Admin calendar. In addition, bear in mind that the admin calendar follows GMT (UTC +0) London time zone.

## See a colleague’s calendar
Let’s say you need to schedule a call where one of your colleagues need to be invited but you’re not sure whether they have any open slots. One solution would be to ask them directly about availability. This would mean that you both will need to stop what you’re doing and work on scheduling that call.

Google calendar has a feature which allows you to add a coworker’s calendar to your calendar. Let’s see how you can do that:

1. Log in to your @balena.io e-mail account and go to calendar.google.com
1. At the "Add a coworkers's calendar" field, write the name or the @balena.io e-mail address of the coworker whose calendar you want to see and click on it
1. Coworker’s calendar entries will show up in your calendar

Hint: if you’re a Mac user, you’ll find the following link really useful, https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect.

## Booking a Zoom room or Google Meet in Google Calendar

Since all scheduled meetings, presentations and discussions are mainly done remotely, it is important to provide a video and audio communication platform where team members can participate. When creating a calendar event, you can choose between a Google Meet or a Zoom link. We would normally use Google Meet for smaller meetings and only use Zoom for company-wide calls as some features work better for the size of our team at the moment.
